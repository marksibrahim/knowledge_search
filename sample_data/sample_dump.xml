'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] encompassing [[anarchist schools of thought|theories and attitudes]] which consider the [[Sovereign state|state]], as compulsory [[government]], to be unnecessary, harmful, and/or undesirable, and favors the [[stateless society|absence of the state]] ([[anarchy]].)&lt;ref name=definitions&gt;*[[Errico Malatesta]], &quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1930s/xx/toanarchy.htm Towards Anarchism]&quot;, ''MAN!''.

Some [[anarchist schools of thought]] differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt; The central tendency of anarchism as a [[social movement]] have been represented by communist anarchism, with anarcho-individualism being primarily a [[philosophical anarchism|philosophical/literary phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;Skirda, Alexandre.

AK Press, 2002, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Some anarchists fundamentally [[non-aggression principle|oppose all forms of aggression]], supporting [[self-defense]] or non-violence, while others have supported the use of some [[coercion|coercive]] measures, including violent revolution and [[terrorism]], on the path to anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R.B. &quot;The Anarchist Tradition of Political Thought.&quot; ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 25, No. 4.

The term ''anarchism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀναρχος, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy]. [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]], &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]], &quot;[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]&quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237439].&lt;/ref&gt; from the prefix ἀν- (''an-'', &quot;without&quot;) + ἄρχή (''archê'', &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell |first=Henry George |coauthors=Scott, Robert |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315894}}&lt;/ref&gt; + -ισμός (''-ismos'', from a [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] -ιζειν, ''-izein''). There is some ambiguity with the use of the terms &quot;[[Libertarianism (disambiguation)|libertarianism]]&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; in writings about anarchism. Since the 1890s from France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0900384891 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dean. [http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], &quot;Ideas on Liberty,&quot; May, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; its use as a synonym is still common outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin.

==Origins==
{{main|History of anarchism}}
Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of [[Taoism|Taoist]] sages [[Laozi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zhuangzi]]. The latter has been translated, ''&quot;There has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success],&quot;'' and ''&quot;A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Concepts of the role of intellectuals in social change toward laissez faire|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynic]]s, and their contemporary [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], also introduced similar topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iep|c/cynics.htm|Cynics|Julie Piering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern anarchism, however, sprang from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt; Although by the turn of the 19th century the term &quot;anarchist&quot; had an entirely positive connotation,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; it first entered the English language in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]] as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]] used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to damn those who were fomenting disorder.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as [[oxymoron]]ic.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; From this climate [[William Godwin]] developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;/&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, [[Benjamin Tucker]] credits [[Josiah Warren]], an American who promoted stateless and [[voluntary community|voluntary communities]] where all goods and services were [[privatization|private]], with being &quot;the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1).&lt;/ref&gt; The first to describe himself as an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006. Hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]] of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at [[University of Westminster]], [[Ruth Kinna]], Senior Lecturer in Politics at [[Loughborough University]], and [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], philosopher and historian.&lt;/ref&gt; a French philosopher and politician, which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
Anarchist ideas have only occasionally inspired political movements of any size, and &quot;the tradition is mainly one of individuals thinkers, but they have produced an important body of theory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=apstK1qIvvMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Political Ideology Today] p. 115. Manchester University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist and collectivist ones, which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the collectivist wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In chronological and theorical sense there are classical -those created throughout the 19th century- and post-classical anarchist schools -those created since the mid-20th century and after.

===Individualist anarchism===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism comprises several traditions&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which hold that &quot;individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, Andrew, ''Key Concepts in Politics'', Palgrave, ISBN 0-312-23381-7, 2000, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is supportive of property being held privately, unlike the socialist/collectivist/communitarian wing which advocates [[common ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeden, Michael. ''Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 019829414X. p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism has been espoused by individuals such as [[Max Stirner]],[[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=woodcock20&gt;Woodcock, George. 2004. ''Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements''. Broadview Press. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ellwood. ''The Goodly Word: The Puritan Influence in America Literature'', Clements Publishing, 2005, p. 138.&lt;br /&gt;''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', edited by [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]], Alvin Saunders Johnson, 1937, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]], [[Albert Jay Nock]]&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Andrew. ''Modern Political Ideologies''. Wiley-Blackwell (p. 116).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Murray Rothbard]].&lt;ref&gt; Brooks, Frank H. 1994.

[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Godwin]], usually considered an individualist anarchist, is often regarded as producing the first philosophical expression of anarchism]]
==== Philosophical anarchism ====
{{Main|Philosophical anarchism}}
Philosophical anarchism is a component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gabardi, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0554%28198603%2980%3A1%3C300%3AA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 review] of ''Anarchism'' by David Miller, published in ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 80, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 300-302.&lt;/ref&gt; which contends that the [[Sovereign state|State]] lacks [[legitimacy|moral legitimacy]] but does not advocate revolution to eliminate it. Though philosophical anarchism does not necessarily imply any action or desire for the elimination of the State, philosophical anarchists do not believe that they have an obligation or duty to obey the State, or conversely, that the State has a right to command. Philosophical anarchists may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical anarchists of historical note include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Herbert Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with [[William Godwin]] that advocates [[self-government]] with a &quot;progressive [[rationalism]] that included benevolence to others.&quot; The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egoism]], as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is &quot;found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution.&quot; The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market. ''Freeden, Micheal. Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach. Oxford University Press. ISBN 019829414X. pp. 313-314''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]],&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., ''Instead of a Book, by a Man too Busy to Write One: A Fragmentary Exposition of Philosophical Anarchism'' (1897, New York).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, John C. Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation. American Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Autumn, 1955). p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary philosophical anarchists include [[Robert Paul Wolff]]. According to scholar [[Allan Antliff]], [[Benjamin Tucker]] coined the term &quot;philosophical anarchism,&quot; to distinguish peaceful evolutionary anarchism from revolutionary variants.&lt;ref&gt;Antliff, Allan. 2001. Anarchist Modernism: Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde. University of Chicago Press. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As conceived by [[William Godwin]], it requires individuals to act in accordance with their own judgments and to allow every other individual the same liberty; conceived egoistically as by [[Max Stirner]], it implies that 'the unique one' who truly 'owns himself' recognizes no duties to others; within the limit of his might, he does what is right for him.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). &quot;Anarchism,&quot; in ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought''. (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

The New Hegelians.

&quot;Egoism&quot; had inspire many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. Stiner was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and [[LGBT]] activist [[John Henry Mackay]]. Individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner attracted a small following of European bohemian artists and intellectuals. Stirner's philosophy have been see like a precedent of [[existentialism]] with other thinkers like [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], or even [[Sören Kierkegaard]].  Russian anarchists like [[Lev Chernyi]] were also atraccted by Stirner ideas, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;Levy, Carl. &quot;[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_1/Anarchism.html Anarchism].&quot; Microsoft [[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected organizing, believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. &quot;The Anarchists in the Russian Revolution.&quot; ''Russian Review'', Vol. 26, No. 4.

Another form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States, as advocated by the &quot;Boston anarchists.&quot;&lt;ref name=levy /&gt; By default American individualists didn't have any problem that &quot;one man employ another&quot; or that &quot;he direct him,&quot; in his labor but demanded that &quot;all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. &quot;Anarchism in the United States.&quot; ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; They believed [[state monopoly capitalism]] (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly)&lt;ref name=schwartzman&gt;Schwartzman, Jack. &quot;Ingalls, Hanson, and Tucker: Nineteenth-Century American Anarchists.&quot; ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Vol. 62, No. 5 (November, 2003). p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; prevented labor from being fully rewarded. [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists &quot;are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centered upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;de Cleyre, Voltairine.

Even among the nineteenth century American individualists, there was not a monolithic doctrine, as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including [[intellectual property]] rights and [[Possession (law)|possession]] versus [[property]] in land.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander.

===Mutualism===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labor movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticized [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does “what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0802054587 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Godwin, Proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action. He saw anarchy as &quot;a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=Selected Writings |publisher=Anchor Books |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |year=1969 | oclc = 221546850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By &quot;commune&quot;, Proudhon meant local [[self-government]] or according to literal translation, &quot;municipality&quot;, rather than a communist arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Samuel. 1985. ''French Political and Intellectual''. History. Transaction Publishers. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon's famous declaration that &quot;[[Property is Theft!]],&quot; along with his less famous declaration that &quot;Property is Liberty,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economictheories.org/2008/11/joseph-proudhon-private-property.html Pierre Joseph Proudhon What Is Property.

Proudhon's ideas were introduced by [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]],&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his &quot;Bank of the People&quot;]'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[individualist anarchists]] in the United States including [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[William Batchelder Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot;On Picket Duty&quot;, ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881–1908)''; 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to Greene, in the mutualist system each worker would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''.

''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy [http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Preface]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and other times as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist anarchism===
{{main|Socialist anarchism}}
Socialist anarchism is one of two different broad categories of anarchism, the other category being individualist anarchism. The term socialist anarchism is often used to identify [[communitarian]] forms of anarchism that emphasize cooperation and mutual aid. Socialist anarchism includes [[anarcho-collectivism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social ecology]] and sometimes [[mutualism]].

====Collectivist anarchism====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
''Collectivist anarchism'', also referred to as ''revolutionary socialism'' or a form of such,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian. Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John. Contemporary Socialism. C. Scribner's sons, 1901, Original from Harvard University. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Johann Most]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot;&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a specific tendency, not to be confused with the broad category sometimes called [[collectivist]] or [[communitarian]] anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Christopher W. 1998. ''An Essay on the Modern State''. Cambridge University Press. p 50. The collectivist ''category'' is also sometimes known as social, socialist, or communitarian anarchism category.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or &quot;[[propaganda by the deed]],&quot; which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot;/&gt;  However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by later anarcho-communists as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=9781904859109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas were not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0521361826 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship{{ndash}} their dictatorship, of course{{ndash}} can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kropotkin Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|Anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] believed that in [[anarchy]], workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society.]]

====Anarchist communism====
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
Anarchist communists propose that the freest form of [[social organisation]] would be a society composed of [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] with collective use of the [[means of production]], organized by [[direct democracy]], and related to other communes through [[federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;[[Isaac Puente|Puente, Isaac]].[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot;]. ''The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review''. Issue 6 Orkney 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some anarchist communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor [[consensus democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Graeber|Graeber, David]] and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In anarchist communism, as money would be abolished, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or payment) but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing (1991) ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] and later [[Murray Bookchin]], the members of such a society would spontaneously perform all necessary labour because they would recognize the benefits of communal enterprise and mutual aid.&lt;ref&gt;

''Conquest of Bread'' was essentially a handbook on the organization of a society after the [[social revolution]].

In response to those criticizing Kropotkin for supporting expropriation of homes and means of production from those who did not wish to take part in anarcho-communism, he replied that if someone did not want to join the commune they would be left alone as long as they are a &quot;peasant who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate,&quot; or &quot;a family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space... considered necessary for that number of people&quot; or an artisan &quot;working with their own tools or handloom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kropotkin-Act-104-05&quot;&gt;Kropotkin ''Act for yourselves.''

The status of anarchist communism within anarchism is disputed, because most individualist anarchists consider [[communitarianism]] incompatible with [[political freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Yarros|Yarros, Victor S.]] &quot;A Princely Paradox&quot;, ''Liberty'', Vol 4.

''What is Mutualism?''&lt;/ref&gt; However, anarcho-communism does not always have a [[communitarian]] philosophy, Some forms of anarchist communism are [[Ethical egoism|egoist]],&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and are very influenced by radical individualist philosophy, believing that anarcho-communism does not require a communitarian nature at all. Anarchist communist [[Emma Goldman]] blended the philosophies of both Max Stirner and Kropotkin in her own.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Platformism]] is an anarchist communist tendency in the tradition of [[Nestor Makhno]], who argued for the &quot;vital need of an organization which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anarcho-syndicalism====
{{main|Syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[Image:Anarchist flag.svg|right|thumb|A common [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-Syndicalist]] flag.]]
In the early 20th century, anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David, ''A History of the French Anarchist Movement'', 1917–1945 p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, [[syndicalism]] posits radical [[trade union]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically [[Workers' self-management|self-managed by the workers]].

Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles include workers' solidarity, [[direct action]] (such as [[general strike]]s and workplace recuperations), and [[workers' self-management]]. This is compatible with other branches of anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to [[anarchist communism|anarchist communist]] or [[collectivist anarchist]] [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Iain Mckay |title=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2008 |isbn=1902593901 |oclc=182529204|chapter=Are there different types of social anarchism? |url=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html#seca32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a trade union centered anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution. An early leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker was [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism'' outlined a view of the movement's origin, aims and importance to the future of labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism]'' by [[Rudolf Rocker]], retrieved 7 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although more often associated with labor struggles of the early 20th century (particularly in [[Anarchism in France|France]] and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]]), many syndicalist organizations are active today, united across national borders by membership in the [[International Workers Association]], including the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] (SAC) in [[Sweden]], the ''[[Unione Sindacale Italiana]]'' (USI) in [[Italy]], the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and the [[Confederación General del Trabajo|CGT]] in Spain, the Workers' Solidarity Movement (WSM) of Ireland, and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the United States.

&quot;Anarchism without adjectives&quot;, in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, &quot;referred to an [[hyphen|unhyphenated]] form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as [[Anarchist communism|communist]], [[collectivism|collectivist]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]], or [[individualist anarchism|individualist]]. For others,…[it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Anarchism without adjectives&quot; emphasizes harmony among various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs.
The position was first adopted in 1889 by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] as a call for [[toleration]], after being troubled by the &quot;bitter debates&quot; among the different anarchist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltairine de Cleyre]],&lt;ref&gt;Voltairine De Cleyre, &quot;Why I Am an Anarchist&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Errico Malatesta]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Nettlau|Nettlau, Max]]. ''A Short History of Anarchism'' [pp. 198–9].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Woodworth]] are noteworthy exponents of the view.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]'', [[Paul Avrich]] (2006). p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-classical schools of thought===

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools have emerged. [[Anarcho-capitalism]] developed from radical anti-state [[libertarianism]] as a rejuvenated form of [[individualist anarchism]], it draws from ideas like [[Austrian School]], [[law and economics]] or [[public choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stringham,  [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=53&amp;articleID=686 ''Anarchy, State, and Public Choice''], Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while the burgeoning [[feminism|feminist]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] movements also produced anarchist offshoots.

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;[[left-wing politics|Left]]&quot; and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements, single issue causes and calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought, and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside the leftist milieu. [[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought developed by [[Saul Newman]] and associated with thinkers such as [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. It draws from a wide range of ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is [[insurrectionary anarchism]], which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].

====Anarcho-capitalism====
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism|Free-market anarchism}}
Anarcho-capitalism (or free-market anarchism)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This volume honors the foremost contemporary exponent of market anarchism. One contributor describes Murray Rothbard as 'the most ideologically committed zero-State academic economist on earth'.&quot; Review by Lawrence H. White of &quot;Man, Economy, and Liberty: Essays in honor of Murray N. Rothbard&quot;, published in ''Journal of Economic Literature'', Vol XXVIII, June 1990, p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt; is &quot;based on a belief in the freedom to own private [[property]], a rejection of any form of governmental authority or intervention, and the upholding of the competitive free market as the main mechanism for [[social interaction]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarcho-capitalism.&quot; ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2004. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the historically [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] nature of much of anarchist thought, the status of [[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalism within anarchism]] is disputed, particularly by [[Anarchist communism|communist anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;Jainendra, Jha. 2002. &quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of Teaching of Civics and Political Science''. p. 52. Anmol Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, anarcho-capitalists sometimes argue that socialist schools of anarchism are themselves logically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Narveson|Narveson, Jan]]. 2008. &quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=PUev30VZ04kC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=anarchism/minarchism&amp;ei=OqVWSs2BHZKAzgTYzPwi Anarchism/Minarchism]&quot; p. 103. Ashgate Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists distinguish between [[free market]] capitalism – peaceful voluntary exchange – from [[state capitalism]], which [[Murray Rothbard]] defined as a collusive partnership between [[big business]] and government that uses [[coercion]] to subvert the free market.&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N]]. &quot;A Future of Peace and Capitalism.&quot; ''Modern Political Economy''.

Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard]], ''A Future of Peace and Capitalism''; Murray Rothbard, ''Left and Right: The Prospects for Liberty''.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in its [[natural right]]s-based, [[contractarian]], or [[utilitarian]] formulations, anarcho-capitalism has a theory of [[legitimacy]] that supports private property as long as it was obtained by labor, trade, or gift.&lt;ref name=confiscation&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1969) {{PDFlink|[http://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf ''Confiscation and the Homestead Principle'']|580&amp;nbsp;KB}} ''The Libertarian Forum'' Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that in an anarcho-capitalist society, voluntary market processes would result in the provision of social institutions such as [[Police|law enforcement]], [[National security|defence]] and [[infrastructure]] by competing for-profit firms, [[Charity (practice)|charities]] or [[voluntaryism|voluntary associations]] rather than the [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Hess|Hess, Karl]]. &quot;[http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/dop.html The Death of Politics].&quot; ''Playboy Magazine'', March 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism, law (the non-aggression principle) is enforced by the market but not created by it, while according to [[David D. Friedman]]'s utilitarian version, the law itself is produced by the market.
[[Image:Anarcho-capitalist flag.svg|thumb|A yellow and black flag is often used to represent [[Anarcho-capitalism]].]]
Although the term ''anarcho-capitalism'' was coined by Rothbard, and its origin is attributed to 1960s [[United States]], some historians, including Rothbard, trace the school of thought as far back as the mid-19th century, to market theorists such as [[Gustave de Molinari]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2004) [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Preface. The Production of Security. By Gustave Molinari. 1849, 1977. [http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism has drawn influence from pro-market theorists such as Molinari, [[Frédéric Bastiat]], and [[Robert Nozick]], as well as American individualist thinkers such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon, David.

====Anarcha-feminism====
{{main|Anarcha-feminism}}
[[Image:Anfem.svg|thumb|A purple and black flag is often used to represent [[Anarcha-feminism]].]]
Anarcha-feminism is a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government – to which anarchists are opposed. Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and even [[Dora Marsden]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s.

Many [[anarcha-feminists]] are especially critical of marriage. For instance, Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that &quot;…[woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, &quot;Marriage and Love&quot;, ''Red Emma Speaks'', p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminists view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against [[sexism]] and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[capitalism]]. [[L. Susan Brown|Susan Brown]] expressed the sentiment that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Susan Brown|Brown, Susan]]. &quot;Beyond Feminism: Anarchism and Human Freedom&quot; ''Anarchist Papers 3'' Black Rose Books (1990) p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several male anarcha-feminists, such as the [[Anarcho communism|Anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] who opposed [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]'s [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] views.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchist-Communism'' by Alain Pengam.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Wendy McElroy]] has defined a position (she describes it as &quot;[[ifeminism]]&quot; or &quot;individualist feminism&quot;) that combines feminism with anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism, arguing that a pro-capitalist, anti-state position implies [[equal rights]] and [[empowerment]] for women.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy McElroy, ''[http://www.wendymcelroy.com/xxx/ XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchist feminism has grown from the [[United States|US]]-based [[individualist anarchism]] movement.

====Green anarchism====
{{main|Green anarchism}}
[[Image:Darker green and Black flag.svg|right|thumb|Green and black flag of [[Green Anarchism]].]]
Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism)&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper (1996). [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=PQOvkB7UoWgC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq= Modern Environmentalism] p. 44. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is a school of thought within anarchism which puts an emphasis on [[environmental issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams (2001). [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=apstK1qIvvMC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq= Political Ideology Today] p. 130. Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Important contemporary currents are [[social ecology]] and [[anarcho-primitivism]]. Many advocates of green anarchism and primitivism consider [[Fredy Perlman]] as the modern progenitor of their views. Notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include the techno-positives [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Janet Biehl]], [[Daniel Chodorkoff]], anthropologist [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]], and people around [[Institute for Social Ecology]]; those critical of technology such as [[Derrick Jensen]], George Draffan, and [[John Zerzan]]; and others including [[Alan Carter (philosopher)|Alan Carter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction |last=Ward |first=Colin |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |date=2004 |isbn=0192804774}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stewart Davidson &lt;ref&gt;Stewart Davidson, 2009, 'EcoAnarchism: A Critical Defence', in the Journal of Political Ideologies, volume 14, pp. 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social ecologists, considered also a kind of socialist anarchists, often criticize the main currents of anarchism for their focus and debates about politics and economics, instead of a focus on [[eco-system]] (human and environmental) like they do. This theory promote [[libertarian municipalism]] and [[green technology]]. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize mainstream anarchism for supporting [[civilization]] and modern [[technology]] which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation.  They instead advocate the process of [[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]] or reconnecting with the natural environment. [[Veganarchism]] is the political philosophy of [[veganism]] (more specifically [[animal liberation]]) and green anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;essay&quot;&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, pp. 1, 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This encompasses viewing the [[Sovereign state|state]] as unnecessary and harmful to both human and animals, whilst practising a vegan diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;essay&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

== As a social movement==
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, &quot;Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters&quot;, in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, anarchists were specially active in the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], and have been active in the [[labor movement]], [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[women's liberation]], both anti-capitalism and pro-capitalism&lt;ref name=&quot;tormey&quot;/&gt; (with varying definitions of capitalism), the [[anti-war movement]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], both [[anti-globalization]] and pro-[[globalization]] (with varying definitions of globalization), [[tax resistance]], and other forms of anarchist activism. 

===The First International===
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|right|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], wherein ten countries experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist revolutions. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789 - 1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |location=New York, N.Y |isbn=0-393-09143-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0520247094 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]]. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0595249124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his associates joined the First International – which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarized into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0810117401 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|id=ISBN 0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1–55164–251–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organized labor===
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Revolution}}
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name='How May Day Became a Workers Holiday-resolution'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A627662 |title=How May Day Became a Workers' Holiday |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=4 October 2001 |work=The Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] |quote=(It is) Resolved ... that eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labor from and after 1 May 1886, and that we recommend to labor organizations throughout this district that they so direct their laws so as to conform to this resolution by the time named. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, unions across America prepared a general strike in support of the event.&lt;ref name='How May Day Became a Workers Holiday-strike'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A627662 |title=How May Day Became a Workers' Holiday |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=4 October 2001 |work=The Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when replacement workers attempted to cross the picket line. Police intervention led to the deaths of four men, enraging the workers of the city. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labor movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labor movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organize for the eight hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] became an annual event the following year.

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], [[Christiaan Cornelissen]], etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social [[revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malatesta thought that trade-unions were [[reformism|reformist]], and could even be, at times, [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example [[Labor unions in the United States|US trade-unions]], where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.

The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

=== Russian Revolution===
{{main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)}}
[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Ukraine]], anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin's]] predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist” Marxist state would become a new elite&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Platformtext&quot; /&gt; was supported. [[Platformist]] groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.

===Fight against fascism===
{{main|Anti-fascism}}{{See also|Anarchism in Italy|Anarchism in France|Anarchism in Spain}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivized]] the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. According to [[George Orwell]] and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.

==Internal issues and debates==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
Anarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom/&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century. 

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a [[global]] one, while others do so by [[local]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Enciclopedy of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[Issues in anarchism#Definitional concerns|definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].

'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|brain development disorder]] characterized by impaired [[social interaction]] and [[communication]], and by restricted and repetitive behavior. These signs all begin before a child is three years old.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; Autism involves many parts of the [[Human brain|brain]]; how this occurs is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Amaral/&gt; The two other [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) are [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS]], diagnosed when full criteria for the other two disorders are not met.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare [[mutation]]s, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s or childhood [[vaccine]]s;&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=vaccines/&gt; The [[prevalence]] of ASD is about 6 per 1,000 people, with about four times as many males as females. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and communication skills, there is no known cure.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.&lt;ref name=Howlin/&gt; An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be tolerated as a difference and not treated as a disorder.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|brain development disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rogers SJ |title=What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? |journal=Autism Res |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |pmid=19582867 |doi=10.1002/aur.81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see ''[[#Classification|Classification]]'') from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales|author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]]|publisher=Knopf|year=1995|isbn=0679437851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and turn taking, and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person's hand.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=221–33 |title= Early detection of core deficits in autism |author= Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20046 |pmid=15666338}}&lt;/ref&gt; They display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than usual, although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1123–34 |title= Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review |author= Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x |pmid=15257669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.&lt;ref name=Sigman&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Annu Rev Clin Psychol |year=2006 |volume=2 |pages=327–55 |title= Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives |author= Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 |pmid=17716073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common beliefs, autistic children do not prefer being alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect their quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Interpers Violence |year=2008 |title= Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals |author= Långström N, Grann M, Ruchkin V, Sjöstedt G, Fazel S |doi=10.1177/0886260508322195 |pmid=18701743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2006 |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=621–32 |title= The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |author= Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |pmid=16901289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=Landa&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |title= Early communication development and intervention for children with autism |author= Landa R |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134 |pmid=17326115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |title= Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author= Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===

Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt; categorizes as follows.

*'''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, making sounds, head rolling, or body rocking.
*'''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in a stacks or lines.
*'''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
*'''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=855–66 |title=The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders |author=Lam KSL, Aman MG |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z |pmid=17048092 |url=http://springerlink.com/content/v03747x60562638m/fulltext.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
*'''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking, [[skin picking]], hand biting, and head banging.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt;
No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2000 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |title= Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation |author= Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855 |pmid=11055459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in childhood, about two-thirds of individuals with ASD are affected by [[sleep]] problems; these most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings.

Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A |title= Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=1–2 |pages=108–15 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x |pmid=19220594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freitag CM |title= The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal= Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;ref name=Penn/&gt; Despite extensive investigation, how autism occurs is not well understood.

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the [[nervous system]] begin early during the [[Human embryogenesis|embryonic stage]] of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response.

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing;&lt;ref name=E-S-theory/&gt; this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spelke ES |title= Sex differences in intrinsic aptitude for mathematics and science?: a critical review |journal= Am Psychol |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=950–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16366817 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.60.9.950 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/spelke2005.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These theories are somewhat related to the earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=E-S-theory&gt;{{cite journal |author= Baron-Cohen S |title= Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory |journal= Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1156 |pages=68–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19338503 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic emotions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hamilton AFdC |title= Research review: Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |pmid=19508497 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. [[Executive dysfunction]] hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]], and other forms of executive function.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B |title= Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism |journal= Dev Psychopathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1103–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18838033 |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000527}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hill EL |title= Executive dysfunction in autism |journal= Trends Cogn Sci |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 |pmid=14697400}}&lt;/ref&gt; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL |title= Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world |journal= Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=320–38 |year=2008 |pmid=18956239 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt; 

[[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Happé F, Frith U |title= The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 |pmid=16450045}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=27–43 |title= Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception |author= Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 |pmid=16453071}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=HappeTime&gt;{{cite journal |author= Happé F, Ronald A, [[Robert Plomin|Plomin R]] |title= Time to give up on a single explanation for autism |journal= Nat Neurosci |year=2006 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=1218–20 |doi=10.1038/nn1770 |pmid=17001340}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Dev Rev |year=2007 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=224–60 |title= Cognitive theories of autism |author= Rajendran G, Mitchell P |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay:
*No [[babbling]] by 12 months.
*No [[Gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months.
*No single words by 16 months.
*No two-word spontaneous phrases (other than instances of [[echolalia]]) by 24 months.
*Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt;
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends that all children be [[Screening (medicine)|screened]] for ASD at the 18- and 24-month well-child doctor visits, using autism-specific formal screening tests.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–215 |title= Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |author= Johnson CP, Myers SM, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the UK National Screening Committee recommends against screening for ASD in the general population, because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Autism |year=2006 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=11–35 |title= Screening for autism spectrum disorders: what is the evidence? |author= Williams J, Brayne C |doi=10.1177/1362361306057876 |pmid=16522708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] (many false-negatives) but good [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] (few false-positives).&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wetherby AM, Brosnan-Maddox S, Peace V, Newton L |title= Validation of the Infant–Toddler Checklist as a broadband screener for autism spectrum disorders from 9 to 24 months of age |journal=Autism |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=487–511 |year=2008 |pmid=18805944 |doi=10.1177/1362361308094501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Acta Paediatr |year=2008 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=539–40 |title= The challenge of screening for autism spectrum disorder in a culturally diverse society |author= Wallis KE, Pinto-Martin J |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00720.x |pmid=18373717}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic screening]] for autism is generally still impractical.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;

Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]] or [[childhood disintegrative disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0890420254 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |chapterurl=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/overview_diagnostic_criteria.htm#Autistic |accessdate=2009-02-17 |publisher=&lt;!--comment to foil Citation bot--&gt;|location= &lt;!--comment to foil Citation bot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition= 10th ([[ICD-10]]) |author= [[World Health Organization]] |chapter= F84. Pervasive developmental disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=Kanne&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE |title= Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal= Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=367–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18855144 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[mental retardation]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=349–53 |title= Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |author= Mantovani JF |doi=10.1017/S0012162200210621 |pmid=10855658}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Types of psychological depression|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matson JL, Neal D |title=Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions |journal=Psychiatr Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |year=2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Genet Med |year=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title= Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author= Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laysource= Medical News Today |laydate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the U.S. and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[genotype]]-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ledbetter DH |title= Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype |journal= N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=16 |pages=1728–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18784093 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0806570}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Landa3&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nat Clin Pract Neurol |year=2008 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=138–47 |title= Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |author= Landa RJ |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0731 |pmid=18253102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Arch Dis Child |year=2007 |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |title= How to diagnose autism |author= Dover CJ, Le Couteur A |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280 |pmid=17515625}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 U.S. study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Shattuck PT, Durkin M, Maenner M ''et al.'' |title= Timing of identification among children with an autism spectrum disorder: findings from a population-based surveillance study |journal= J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=474–83 |year=2009 |pmid=19318992 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31819b3848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= National Autistic Society |title= Diagnosis: how can it benefit me as an adult? |year=2005 |url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=8018 |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD|title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|year=2007|volume=13|issue=2|pages=129–35|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143|pmid=17563895}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research|author=Cass H|journal=Autism|year=1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see|History of Asperger syndrome|Sociological and cultural aspects of autism}}

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table talk (literature)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]] contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title= The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality |author= [[Lorna Wing|Wing L]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luther's notetaker [[Johannes Mathesius|Mathesius]], Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh [[Demonic possession|possessed by the devil]], and suggested that he be suffocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Miles M |year=2005 |title= Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |publisher= Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Houston R, Frith U |title= Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0-631-22089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=201–8 |title= The history of autism |author=Wolff S |doi=10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5 |pmid=15365889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kuhn R; tr. Cahn CH|title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology|journal=Hist Psychiatry|volume=15|issue=3|year=2004|pages=361–6|doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603|pmid=15386868}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 |title= Das psychisch abnormale Kind |author= [[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=Kanner1943&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]] |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943}} Reprinted in {{cite journal |year=1968 |journal= Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2022–3 |title= Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism |author= Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 |pmid=17922179 |url=http://springerlink.com/content/m55051670u35066p/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;.

The '''albedo''' of an object is the extent to which it diffusely reflects light from the [[Sun]].  It is therefore a more specific form of the term [[reflectivity]].  Albedo is defined as
the ratio of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] to incident [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is a [[Dimensionless number|unitless]] measure indicative of a surface's or body's diffuse [[reflectivity]]. The word is derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot;, in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, and was introduced into optics 
in by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his [[1760]] work ''Photometria.''
The range of possible values is from 0 (dark) to 1 (bright).
[[Image:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the Earth]]

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. In climatology it is sometimes expressed as a percentage. Its value depends on the [[frequency]] of radiation considered: unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation. Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions in a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incoming distribution. In realistic cases, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) is required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although albedos are a very useful first approximation.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 90% for fresh snow, to about 4% for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[Black body|blackbody]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=P. R. |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2001 |month= |title=Earthshine Observations of the Earth’s Reflectance |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1671–1674 |id= |url=http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2001/2000GL012580.shtml |accessdate= |quote=|doi=10.1029/2000GL012580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds. 

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature [[feedback]]. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments onboard the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  (e.&amp;nbsp;g., 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod09.pdf|title=MODIS BRDF/Albedo Product: Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document, Version 5.0|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar \bar \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s. 

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 86%. Many objects in the outer solar system&lt;ref name=tnoalbedo&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily [[space weathering|space weathered]] surface containing some [[organic compound]]s. 

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 7%, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm A discussion of Lunar albedos]&lt;/ref&gt; While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless solar system bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the [[opposition effect]] of [[regolith]] surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:&lt;ref name=bruton&gt;{{cite web

&lt;math&gt;A =\left ( \frac{1329\times10^{-H/5}}{D} \right ) ^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometres, and ''H'' is the absolute magnitude.

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

Albedo also refers to the white, spongy inner lining of a citrus fruit rind.&lt;ref&gt;wordsmith.org&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr. Renee M. Goodrich, associate professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Florida, the albedo is rich in the soluble fiber pectin and contains vitamin C.

==Some examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===The tropics===
Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases up to 3 °C (5.4 °F) year-round,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, R. E., and P. J. Kennedy, 1992: ''Impacts on regional climate of Amazon deforestation''. Geophys. Res. Lett., '''19''', 1947–1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/final/characterization/abiotic_water.html http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/final/characterization/abiotic_water.html]  Project Amazonia: Characterization - Abiotic - Water&lt;/ref&gt; although part of the effect is due to changed evaporation ([[latent heat]] flux).

===Small scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear lighter color clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html Health and Safety: Be Cool! (8/97)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees===
Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling. [[Cloud feedback]]s further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/Resources/gcc/1-3-3.html | title=The Climate System | publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University | accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between deciduous and coniferous is because coniferous trees are darker in general and have cone-shaped crowns. The shape of these crowns trap radiant energy more effectively than deciduous trees.  

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref&gt;Betts, R.A. (2000) ''Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo'', Nature, Volume 408, Issue 6809, pp. 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 90%; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). 

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[Image:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vih.freeshell.org/pp/01-ONW-St.Petersburg/Fresnel.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. 

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up (not smooth at the scale of the wavelength of light) so the Fresnel equations do not apply. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
{{see|Cloud albedo}}

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields by [[Saddam Hussein]] showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JGR....9714565C The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCNs]] and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As per &lt;ref&gt;DOMINICK V. SPRACKLEN, BORIS BONN, AND KENNETH S. CARSLAW. 2008. Boreal forests, aerosols and the impacts on clouds and climate. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A. doi:10.1098/rsta.2008.0201. http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~eardvs/papers/spracklen08c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
Aerosols can modify the Earth’s radiative balance through the aerosol direct and indirect
effects.
&lt;br /&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Increased CCN concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). A greater number of cloud droplets leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (first indirect effect). Increased CDNC also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (second indirect effect).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR (IPCC)|SAR]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m...&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--When inserting apostrophes in this section, be careful--&gt;
The letter '''A''' is the first letter in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] ({{pronEng|eɪ}}) is spelled '''ae'''&lt;!--Yes, it is spelled &quot;ae&quot;. That's its name, and that's how it's spelled.--&gt;; the plural is ''aes,'' though this is rare.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A&quot; ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989). ''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, a's.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The letter A can be traced to a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s or the [[Proto-Sinaitic alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=A|encyclopedia=The World Book Encyclopedia|volume=1|page=1|publisher=Field Enterprises, Inc|date=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 1600 B.C. the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] [[aleph]].

When the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign for the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and kept its name with a minor change ([[alpha (letter)|alpha]]). In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

[[Image:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-story and single-story '''a'''.]]
The letter has two [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current [[handwriting]], and in [[italic type]], consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|ɑ}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{IPA|a}}). Both derive from the [[majuscule]] (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

== Usage ==
In [[English language|English]], the letter &quot;A&quot; by itself usually denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad'', the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', or, in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[great vowel shift]].  

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter A denotes either an [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑ/}}), or an [[open central unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/a/}}). In the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of the letter A denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital A denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase a denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].

''A'' is the third most common letter in English, and the second most common in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. On average, about 8.2% of letters in English tend to be ''A''s, while the number is 6.2% in Spanish and 4% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbase.trincoll.edu/~crypto/resources/LetFreq.html|title=Percentages of Letter frequencies per Thousand words|accessdate=2006-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A'' is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; A grade for clean restaurants; [[A-List]] celebrities, etc. The number [[1]] is used in a similar way.

A [[turned a|turned 'a']] (ɐ) is used by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] for the [[near-open central vowel]], while a turned capital 'A' (∀) is used in [[predicate logic]] to indicate [[universal quantification]].

== Codes for computing ==
In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] A is codepoint U+0041 and the [[lower case]] a is U+0061.&lt;ref name=&quot;unicode&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macchiato.com/unicode/chart/|title=Javascript Unicode Chart|language=en|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ASCII]] code for capital A is 65 and for lower case a is 97; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000001 and 01100001, respectively.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital A is 193 and for lowercase a is 129.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#65;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#97;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case, respectively.

'''Alabama''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Alabama.ogg|/ˌæləˈbæmə/}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|southern region]] of the [[United States of America]]. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with almost 4.6&amp;nbsp;million residents in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html census.gov |title=Alabama Quick Facts |accessdate=2007-09-08 |work=State and County Quick Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. [[White people|White]] rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and [[African Americans]] were underrepresented.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, accessed March 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following World War II, Alabama experienced significant recovery as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and high technology, as well as the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Air Force]]. Today, the state is heavily invested in aerospace, education, health care, and banking, and various heavy industries including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and [[fabrication]].

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker#Alabama|Yellowhammer]] State'', which is also the name of the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;[[Dixie|Heart of Dixie]]&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and the largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. The largest city by total land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].

In the [[Alabama language]], the word for an Alabama person is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Albàamo'' in different dialects; the plural form &quot;Alabama persons&quot; is ''Albaamaha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; &amp; Montler, Timothy |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=0-292-73077-2 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Alabama'' is believed to have originated from the [[Choctaw language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=William W.|coauthors=Robert D.

Although the origin of ''Alabama'' was evident, the meaning of the tribe's name was not always clear. An article without a [[byline]] appearing in the ''Jacksonville Republican'' on July 27, 1842, originated the idea that the meaning was &quot;Here We Rest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of [[Alexander Beaufort Meek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  Experts in the [[Muskogean languages]] have been unable to find any evidence that would support this translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  It is now generally accepted that the word comes from the Choctaw words ''alba'' (meaning &quot;plants&quot; or &quot;weeds&quot;) and ''amo'' (meaning &quot;to cut&quot;, &quot;to trim&quot;, or &quot;to gather&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanton1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swanton |first=John R. |authorlink=John R.

Alabama was the new frontier in the 1820s and 1830s. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of fertile soils. Planters brought slaves with them, and traders brought in more from the Upper South as the cotton plantations expanded. The economy of the central &quot;[[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]&quot; featured large cotton plantations whose owners built their wealth on the labor of enslaved African Americans. It was named for the dark, fertile soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Elsewhere poor whites were subsistence farmers. According to the 1860 census, enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 free persons of color. 

In 1861 Alabama declared its secession from the Union and joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. While few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the Civil War. All the slaves were freed by 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistDocs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.historicaldocuments.com/13thAmendment.htm

After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly rural and tied to cotton. Planters resisted working with free labor and sought to re-establish controls over African Americans. Whites used paramilitary groups, [[Jim Crow laws]] and segregation to reduce freedoms of African Americans and restore their own dominance.

In its new constitution of 1901, the legislature effectively disfranchised African Americans through voting restrictions. While the planter class had engaged poor whites in supporting these efforts, the new restrictions resulted in disfranchising poor whites as well. By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. This was due mostly to effects of the cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the African-American community was pervasive, as nearly all its citizens lost the ability to vote. In 1900, fourteen Black Belt counties (which were primarily African American) had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had managed to &quot;qualify&quot; to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate. The shut out was long-lasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;  The disfranchisement was ended only by African Americans leading the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights.  The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] also protected the suffrage of poor whites.

The rural-dominated legislature continued to underfund schools and services for African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.southernspaces.org/contents/2004/tullos/4a.htm

They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The rate of population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;Historical Populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910–1920, reflecting the effect of outmigration. 

At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed &quot;The Magic City&quot;.  By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside of Birmingham.

One result was that Jefferson County, home of Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

Because of the long disfranchisement of African Americans, the state continued as one-party Democratic for decades. It produced a number of national leaders. Industrial development related to the demands of [[World War II]] brought prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor [[George Wallace]], many whites in the state opposed integration efforts.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national [[Civil Rights Act]] of 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ''[[De jure]]'' segregation ended in the states as [[Jim Crow laws]] were invalidated or repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the state legislature House and Senate. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population.  This benefited the many urban areas that had developed, and all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

After 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have also voted increasingly Republican in state elections, although Democrats are still the majority party in both houses of the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.southerner.net/v1n1_99/coverstory1.html

===Climate===
The [[climate]] of Alabama is described as [[temperate]] with an average annual temperature of 64&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama ''&quot;Alabama Climate&quot;'', Encyclopedia Britannica, Retrieved May 7, 2007] &lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt; 

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. 

[[Image:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the [[North Alabama]] region. This is shown in this picture taken at the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]] in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]] during early January.]]

South Alabama reports more [[thunderstorms]] than any part of the U.S. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80&amp;nbsp;days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]] – the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990–2003, [http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html ]  Retrieved May 8, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[tornado]]es occur – these are common throughout the state, although the peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama shares the dubious distinction, with [[Kansas]], of having reported more [[Fujita scale|F5 tornadoes]] than any other state – according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950 to October 31, 2006. An F5 tornado is the most powerful of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm Fujita scale]. Tornadoproject.com. Retrieved September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long – tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state except for [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]]. The [[Super Outbreak]] of March, 1974, badly affected Alabama. The northern part of the state – along the Tennessee Valley – is one of the areas in the US most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season (November and December) in addition to the Spring severe weather season.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Snow is a rare event in much of Alabama. Areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

===Religion===
Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]]. In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a &quot;full understanding&quot; of their faith and needed no further learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kirsten |last=Campbell |work=Mobile Register |title=Alabama rates well in biblical literacy |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2007-06-02 |page=A1 |publisher=Advance Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myaea.org/PDFfile/Confidence+in+State+Institutions07.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070809021852/http://www.myaea.org/PDFfile/Confidence+in+State+Institutions07.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-09 |title=Confidence in State and Local Institutions Survey |work=Capital Survey Research Center |accessdate= 2007-06-02 |type=PDF |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=White |title=Poll says we feel good about state Trust in government, unlike some institutions, hasn't fallen |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02 |work=Birmingham News |publisher=Birmingham News |page=13A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mobile area is notable for its large percentage of Catholics, owing to the area's unique early history under French and Spanish rule.

According to the United States [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the 2006 total [[gross state product]] was $160&amp;nbsp;billion, or $29,697 per capita for a ranking of 44th among states. Alabama's GDP increased 3.1% from 2005, placing Alabama number 23 in terms of state level GDP growth. The single largest increase came in the area of durable goods manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/gsp_newsrelease.htm |title=Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by State, 2006 |accessdate=2007-10-16 |work=Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Economic Accounts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, [[per capita income]] for the state was $18,189.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=2007-05-30 |work=State and County Quick Facts }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include [[poultry]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[cattle]], plant nursery items, [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[cereal|grains]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[sorghum]], [[vegetable]]s, [[milk]], [[soybean]]s, and [[peach]]es.

Alabama's [[Industry|industrial]] outputs include [[iron]] and [[steel]] products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[wood]] products; [[mining]] (mostly coal); [[plastic]] products; cars and trucks; and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronics|electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, which is home of the [[NASA]] [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Aviation and Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Alabama is also home to the largest industrial growth corridor in the nation, including the surrounding states of Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida, and Georgia. Most of this growth is due to Alabama's rapidly expanding automotive manufacturing industry. In Alabama alone since 1993, it has generated more than 67,800 new jobs. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2008_fotw539.html automobile output]. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, Birmingham's economy was transformed by investments in bio-technology and medical research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and its adjacent hospital. The UAB Hospital is a Level I trauma center providing health care and breakthrough medical research. UAB is now the area's largest employer and the largest in Alabama with a workforce of about 20,000. Health care services provider HealthSouth is also headquartered in the city.

Birmingham is also a leading banking center, serving as home Regions Financial Corporation. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Madrid-based BBVA in September 2007; the headquarters of the new BBVA Compass Bank remains in Birmingham. SouthTrust, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia in 2004. The city still has major operations as one of the regional headquarters of Wachovia. In November 2006, Regions Financial merged with AmSouth Bancorporation, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. They formed the 8th Largest U. S. Bank (by total assets). Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Magic City, such as Superior Bank and New South Federal Savings Bank.

Telecommunications provider AT&amp;T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence with several large offices in the metropolitan area. Major insurance providers: Protective Life, Infinity Property &amp; Casualty and ProAssurance among others, are headquartered in Birmingham and employ a large number of people in Greater Birmingham. The city is also a powerhouse of construction and engineering companies, including BE&amp;K and B. L. Harbert International which routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design and international construction firms.

Huntsville is regarded for its high-technology driven economy and is known as the &quot;Rocket City&quot; due to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Redstone Arsenal. Huntsville's main economic influence is derived from aerospace and military technology. Redstone Arsenal, Cummings Research Park (CRP), The University of Alabama in Huntsville and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center comprise the main hubs for the area's technology-driven economy. CRP is the second largest research park in the United States and the fourth largest in the world, and is over 38 years old. Huntsville is also home for commercial technology companies such as the network access company ADTRAN, computer graphics company Intergraph and design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure Avocent. Telecommunications provider Deltacom, Inc. and copper tube manufacturer and distributor Wolverine Tube are also based in Huntsville. Cinram manufactures and distributes 20th Century Fox DVDs and Blu-ray Discs out of their Huntsville plant. Sanmina-SCI also has a large presence in the area. Forty-two Fortune 500 companies have operations in Huntsville.  In 2005, Forbes Magazine named the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area as 6th best place in the nation for doing business, and number one in terms of the number of engineers per total employment.

The city of[[Mobile, Alabama]]'s only saltwater port, is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].  The [[Port of Mobile]] is the 10th largest by tonnage in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ports1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports in 2006&quot;|work=&quot;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Waterborne Commerce Statistics&quot;|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portton06.htm|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2007, a site north of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] was selected by German steelmaker [[ThyssenKrupp]] for a $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion steel production plant, with the promise of 2,700 permanent jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''ThyssenKrupp's Alabama incentive package tops $811&amp;nbsp;million''|publisher=Press register|date=2007-05-11|url=http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/business-2/1178924126194090.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxes==
Alabama's tax structure is one the most [[regressive tax|regressive]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Zengerle |first = Jason  |title =  2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Biblical Taxation |publisher = New York Times |date = December 14, 2003 |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E3DB1E3DF937A25751C1A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=biblical%20taxation&amp;st=cse |accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status, though taxpayers can deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, which favors wealthier Alabamians who typically pay federal taxes.

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes, July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 9% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 10% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51 percent of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36 percent nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line. Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970–2007) |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Property taxes are the lowest in the United States. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes. One of its amendments lowered the percentage of fair-market value at which property was taxed and another declared that timber and farmland would be taxed on the value of its current use instead of what the land is worth.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million. It is one of only a few states to accomplish large surpluses, with a budget surplus of nearly $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007, and estimated at more than $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion for 2008.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} However, the declining national economy in 2008 has eliminated that surplus and the state is again facing shortfall, with the governor declaring &quot;proration,&quot; which will result in an immeditate education budget cut and school layoffs.

==Transportation==
[[Image:Alabama.JPG|thumb|right|Alabama state welcome sign.]]


Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross it: [[I-65]] runs north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-59/I-20 travels from the central west border to Birmingham, where [[I-59]] continues to the north-east corner of the state and [[I-20]] continues east towards Atlanta; [[I-85]] originates in Montgomery and runs east-northeast to the Georgia border, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, running from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate road, [[I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed around 2012 it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Several US Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]], [[U.S. Route 29|US 29]], [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]], [[U.S. Route 43|US 43]], [[U.S. Route 72|US 72]], [[U.S. Route 78|US 78]], [[U.S. Route 80|US 80]], [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]], [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]], [[U.S. Route 98|US 98]], [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]], and [[U.S. Route 280|US 280]].

Major airports in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL), [[Tuscaloosa Regional Airport]] (TCL), and [[Pryor Field Regional Airport]] (DCU). For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.

==Law and government==
[[Image:Alabama state capitol, Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The State Capitol, built in 1850]]

===State government===
{{main|Government of Alabama}}

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|title = Constitution of Alabama - 1901

|url = http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm
|accessdate = 2006-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform]&lt;/ref&gt; This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. 

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[Alabama State Auditor]].

The [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]].

===Local and county government===
Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Due to the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.
*[[List of Alabama county seats]]

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves &quot;dry&quot;; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

===State politics===
[[Image:Bob Riley greeting soldiers in Birmingham, 19 Jan, 2004.jpg|thumb|Alabama Governor Bob Riley in 2004]]

The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is [[Jim Folsom Jr]]. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat [[Sue Bell Cobb]]. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] currently holds a large majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. Due to the Legislature's power to override a gubernatorial [[veto]] by a mere simple majority (most state Legislatures require a 2/3 majority to override a veto), the relationship between the executive and legislative branches can be easily strained when different parties control the branches.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.

From 1901 to the 1960s, the state legislature failed to perform redistricting as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972. 

With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. 

In the 1986 Democratic primary election, the then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor lost the Democratic nomination for Governor. The state Democratic party invalidated the election and placed the Lieutenant Governor's name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of the candidate chosen in the primary. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger [[Guy Hunt]] as Governor. This was the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction. Since then, Republicans have become increasingly competitive in Alabama politics. They currently control [[111th United States Congress|both seats]] in the U.S. Senate, four out of the state's [[111th United States Congress|seven congressional seats]].  Republicans hold an 8-1 majority on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor - Breaking News from The Birmingham News - al.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have a 5-2 majority among [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices.

However, Democrats currently hold all three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible - Breaking News from The Birmingham News - al.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they maintain control of both houses of the legislature, holding approximately 59.4% of seats in the [[Alabama Senate]] and 58.7% of seats in the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]. A majority of local offices in the state are still held by Democrats. Generally speaking, local elections in rural counties are decided in the Democratic Primary and local elections in metropolitan counties are decided in the Republican Primary although there are exceptions to this rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results - Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results - Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one Republican Lt. Governor has been elected since Reconstruction, [[Steve Windom]]. Windom served as [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|Lt. Governor]] under Democratic Gov. [[Don Siegelman]].  The last time that Alabama had a governor and Lt. governor of the same party was the period between 1983-1987 when Wallace was serving his fourth term as governor and [[Bill Baxley]] was serving as Lt. Governor, both were Democrats.

An overwhelming majority of sheriff's offices in Alabama are in [[Democratic]] hands. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over more rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republicans preside over more urban/suburban and more populated counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/?PageID=131&amp;IsNav=true |title=Association |publisher=Alabama Sheriffs |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only three Alabama counties (Tuscaloosa, Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and only five [[Counties of Alabama|Alabama counties]] with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/Image.aspx?ImageID=11481&amp;Title=2007-2011+Alabama+Sheriffs |title=2007-2011 Alabama Sheriffs |publisher=Alabamasheriffs.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. [[George Wallace]], the state's governor, remains a notorious and controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and the Governor signed, a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by large margins. 1960 was a curious election. The Democrats won with [[John F. Kennedy]] on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to [[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] carried the state, in part because of his opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which restored the franchise for African Americans.

In [[United States presidential election, 1968|the 1968 presidential election]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]] over both [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Wallace was the official [[Democratic]] candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the &quot;National Democratic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=1968&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0 |title=1968 Presidential General Election Results - Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=1968-11-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Democratic candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and comprise a longstanding majority in the [[Alabama Legislature]]; see [[Dixiecrat]].

In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The eleven counties that voted Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are the majority racial group. 

The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans. 

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, four of whom are Republicans: ([[Jo Bonner]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], and [[Spencer Bachus]]) and three are Democrats: ([[Bobby Bright]], [[Parker Griffith]] and [[Artur Davis]]).

==Health, education, and policy==
===Primary and secondary education===
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf
|title = Alabama Education Quick Facts 2007
|accessdate = 2007-08-11
|format = PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;/&gt; In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. In 2004, only 23 percent of schools met AYP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AYP&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title = Eighty-Two Percent of Alabama Schools Make AYP While Increasing Annual Measurable Objectives
|accessdate = 2007-08-11 
|format = PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

However, while Alabama's public education system has improved, it still lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate – 75% – is the second lowest in the United States (after Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html CensusScope - Education Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and universities===

[[Image:Harrison-plaza2.jpg|right|thumb|220px| Harrison Plaza at the [[University of North Alabama]] in Florence. The school was chartered as LaGrange College by the [[Alabama Legislature]] in 1830.]]

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, numerous two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from 2-year associate degrees to 16 doctoral level programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache&quot;&gt; {{cite web |work=Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title=Degree titles and abbreviations |url=http://www.ache.state.al.us/Acadaffr/ProInv/Degreeabbr.htm  |type=html |accessdate 3007-09-03}}{{dead link|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges as well as a plethora of subject focused national and international accreditation agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title=Accreditation |url=http://www.ache.state.al.us/Colleges&amp;Universities/Accreditation/index.htm |accessdate 2007-09-03  |type=html}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Leon Benouville The Wrath of Achilles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Wrath of Achilles'', by [[François-Léon Benouville]] (1821&amp;ndash;1859) ([[Musée Fabre]])]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|Ἀχιλλεύς}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[hero]] of the [[Trojan War]], the [[central character]] and the greatest warrior of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''.

Achilles also has the attributes of being the most handsome of the heroes assembled against [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]],'' [[Symposium (Plato)#Phaedrus|180a]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later legends (beginning with a poem by [[Statius]] in the first century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his [[heel]].  Legend states that Achilles was semi-immortal, however his heel was vulnerable. Since he died due to a poisoned arrow shot into his heel, the &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a person's principal weakness. 

==Birth==
Achilles was the son of the [[nymph]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fire-bringer, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed  Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755-768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34-37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26-47; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ii.15)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.760) [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis's chaste resistance to the advances of [[Zeus]], that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.&lt;!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:&quot;Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get.&quot;--&gt;

[[Image:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (ca. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]]]
According to a fragment of an ''Achilleis''— the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the first century AD, and to no other sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body she held him by, his heel. (See [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]].) It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869-479.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.  To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood.&quot;

Also in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death, [[Cypria|Kúpria]] (unknown author), ''[[Aithiopis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], ''[[Little Iliad|Ilias Mikrá]]'' by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou pérsis by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase-paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. 

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87-89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achilles in the Trojan War==
[[Image:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]

The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{Polytonic|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}
:{{Polytonic|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}

:Sing, Goddess, of the rage, of Peleus' son Achilles
:the accursed rage, which brought pain to thousands of the Achaeans.

Achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage. His anger is at some times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative. 

===Telephus===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles heals him in order that he become their guide for the voyage to Troy. 
		
According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.

===Troilus===
According to the [[Cypria]] (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 Proclus' Summary of the Cypria]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html Dares' account of the destruction of Troy, Greek Mythology Link.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, [[Troilus]] was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King [[Priam]]'s (or sometimes [[Apollo]]) and [[Hecuba]]'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilas and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth - who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.  Later versions of the story suggested Troilas was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot; in ''London Review of Books;'' 19 July 2007[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html] accessed October 23rd, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed Troy would have been invincible.

===In the ''Iliad''===
[[Image:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th century illuminated manuscript.]]
{{main|Iliad}}

[[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the [[Trojan War]]. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begged Agamemnon to return her to him.  Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks.  The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis)&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the urging of Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.

As the battle turned against the Greeks, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agreed and sent [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles took back Briseis and refused the other gifts and urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

Eventually, however, hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle, Achilles prayed to his mother Thetis, asking her to plead with Zeus to allow the Trojans to push back the Greek forces.
 
The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] led the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, though Achilles remained at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

[[Image:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|250px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]]. (From a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]])]]
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his close friend's death and held many funeral games in his honor.  His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded [[Hephaestus]] to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by [[Hector]]. The new armor included the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail by the poet.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Triumphant Achilles in Achilleion cc.jpg|thumb|250px|This is a color-corrected version of the original image above.]] --&gt;
Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.  Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed.  The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus.  Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet.  Finally Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realized the trick, he knew the battle was inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but missed. Accepting his fate, Hector begged Achilles &amp;ndash; not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles told Hector it was hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw &amp;mdash; such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991, p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then got his vengeance, killing Hector with a single blow to the neck and tying the Trojan's body to his [[chariot]], dragging it around the battlefield for nine days.

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector's father, [[Priam]], went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites.  The final passage in the ''Iliad'' is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time.

===Penthesilea===
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]], but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, due to Penthesilia's superior fighting skills, he refocused, and killed her. As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of Thersites laughed and mocked the great Achilles. Annoyed by his insensitivity and disrespect, Achilles punched him in the face and killed him instantly.

===Memnon, and the fall of Achilles===
[[Image:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Achilleion_(Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]

Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son [[Antilochus]].  When [[Memnon]], king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] killed Antilochus, Achilles was once again drawn onto the battlefield to seek revenge. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century B.C. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. 

As predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to [[Statius]]). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris's arrow.  Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.
[[Image:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure ''[[lekythos]]'', ca. 510 BCE, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich]] Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented  in the lost Trojan War epic of [[Arctinus of Miletus]] as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]] (see below).  Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, Polyxena, Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage.  Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior.  But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow killing him.

Paris was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].

===Fate of Achilles' armor===
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus. Odysseus won. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena.  Athena temporarily made Ajax mad with grief and anguish as he began killing sheep, thinking they were his comrades.  After a while, Athena had lifted the madness and Ajax had seen that he had actually been killing sheep.  In his embarrassment, he then committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear, which he would indeed have touched with excitement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; (Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great''1973.144.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was being shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the second century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias,  iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65-85) esp. p. 81. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Achilles and Patroclus==
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}
Achilles' relationship with Patroclus is a key aspect of his myth.  Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.  In the ''[[Iliad]]'', they appeared to be generally portrayed as a model of deep and loyal friendship.  However, commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus, in 5th century BC Athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as [[pederastic]]. Contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual &quot;war buddies&quot;, or as an egalitarian [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] couple.

==The cult of Achilles in antiquity==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Briseis and Achilles.jpg|thumb|right|Achilles and Briseis]]

There was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, ''Leuce'']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Hedreen, &quot;The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine&quot; ''Hesperia'' '''60'''.3 (July 1991), pp. 313-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lost epic ''[[Aithiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''[[Iliad]]'' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]],  Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a [[tumulus]] for him and celebrated funeral games.

[[Pliny's Natural History]] (IV.27.1) mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (''Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara''), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue” (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.

[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister (''De situ orbis'', II, 7). And the Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor” (''Orbis descriptio'', v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913).

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' gives the following details: &quot;It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships”. (quoted in Densuşianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as ''Pontarches'' the lord and master of the Pontic (Black) Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] (Densuşianu 1913) even thought he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (&quot;Achileii&quot;), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&quot;

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.  [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.

===The cult of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu===
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] [[Greece]], Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: ''[[Corfu#Beauty, Power and Tragedy: The Achilleion|Achilleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].

==The name of Achilles==
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{Polytonic|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{Polytonic|λαός}} (''Laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers'', a [[Muster_(military)|muster]]. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks early after 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search_main.html Epigraphical database] gives 164 matches for Ἀχιλλεύς and 368 for Ἀχιλλε.The earliest ones: Corinth 7th c. BC,Delphi 530 BC,Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also turned into the female form of Ἀχιλλεία, ''Achilleía'', firstly attested in Attica,4th century BC, (IG II² 1617) and [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|Achillia]], [[:Image:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|a relief from Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting, 'Amazonia'.  Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea, but give it an extra twist of Achilles being 'played' by a woman.

==Other stories about Achilles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
[[Image:Achilles in Corfu.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles]] 
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].  There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of [[Statius]] he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

In book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]],'' Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.  This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]], the location of the mythical &quot;White Island&quot; which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.

The kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epiran princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy.

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (mythology)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades — as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' [[Argonautica]]. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].

==Achilles in Greek tragedy==
{{main|Achilles (play)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the [[Trojan War]], including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.  The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote a play with Achilles as the main character, ''The Lovers of Achilles''. Only a few fragments survive.

==Achilles in Greek philosophy==
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centered one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;swift-footed&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th]] [[President of the United States]], serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. He successfully led his country through its greatest internal crisis, the [[American Civil War]], preserving the Union and ending slavery. Before his election in 1860 as the first [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] president, Lincoln had been a [[country lawyer]], an [[Illinois]] [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]],

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holzer|2004|p=232}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in 1860 and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president]] later that year. His tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] [[Confederate States of America]] in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of [[slavery]], issuing his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 and promoting the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution. As the civil war was drawing to a close, Lincoln became the first American president to be [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassinated]].

Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top [[Military rank|generals]], including [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], a war scare with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], in 1861. Under his leadership, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].

[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and other opponents of the war criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the [[Radical Republicans]], an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these road blocks, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his [[Gettysburg Address]] is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His successor in the White House, Andrew Johnson, also wanted reconciliation among white Americans, but failed to protect the rights of newly freed slaves. Abraham Lincoln has consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest U.S. Presidents]].&lt;ref name=Scholar_surveys&gt;Note especially Lincoln's ranking in the [[Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents#Scholar_survey_results|Scholar survey results]] section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Childhood and education===

[[Image:HinghamSign.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Lincoln, first American ancestor of Abraham, worshipped at Old Ship Church, Hingham, Massachusetts]]
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks]], two uneducated farmers, in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the {{convert|348|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast [[Hardin County, Kentucky]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]), making him the first president born west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].
&lt;!-- except for Fillmore, who was born in Summerhill, NY - on the west side of the Appalachian-Alleghany-Adirondack ridge--&gt; 
Lincoln was not given a middle name. Lincoln's ancestor [[Samuel Lincoln]]&lt;ref&gt;In 1848 attorney and historian Solomon Lincoln of [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], began a correspondence with Abraham Lincoln to determine whether the future President's ancestors originated in Massachusetts. Fortunately, Solomon Lincoln saved his correspondence with distant relation Abraham, which the Hingham lawyer published in 1865 in his book ''Notes on the Lincoln Families of Massachusetts with Some Account of the Family of Abraham Lincoln, Late President of the United States''.

For some time, Thomas Lincoln, Abraham's father, had been a respected citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|200|1808}}}} today){{inflation-fn|US}} and assumption of a debt. The family belonged to a [[Primitive Baptist|Hardshell Baptist]] church, although Abraham himself never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.
In 1816 the Lincoln family became impoverished, losing their land through court action, and was forced to make a new start in [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]], Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;
It is now in [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]), Indiana. &lt;/ref&gt; 
Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery,&quot; and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt; 
Unlike land in the [[Northwest Territory]], Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property in lawsuits such as the one Thomas Lincoln lost.
&lt;/ref&gt;
When Lincoln was nine, his mother, then 34 years old, died of [[milk sickness]]. Soon afterwards, his father remarried to [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]]. Lincoln and his stepmother were close; he called her &quot;Mother&quot; for the rest of his life, but he was increasingly distant from his father.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp= 28, 152}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land&lt;ref&gt;

in [[Macon County, Illinois]]. The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]] to the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans]] via flatboat on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers.
Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated and an avid reader. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Sandburg|1974|p=10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
At 6&amp;nbsp;foot 4&amp;nbsp;inches (1.93&amp;nbsp;m), he was unusually tall, as well as strong.
Lincoln's father, Thomas Lincoln, was uneducated and illiterate; however, he was extremely talented in the art of storytelling and entertaining friends. Thomas would regularly host friendly gatherings at his house, which would usually consist of Thomas telling stories all night causing a hilarious uproar from his audience. Stealthily, young Abraham would stay up and listen to his father telling stories, trying to memorize them himself. Occasionally, when Abraham could not understand a certain story or part of one, he would repeat it over and over again in his mind until he finally understood. He then would spend countless hours coming up with a way to put the stories into terms his friends could easily understand. The next day, Abraham would repeat these stories to his friends, mimicking his father. This early practice helped prepare Abraham for the many important speeches he would have to give later in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;teamofrivals&quot;&gt;

===Marriage and family===

|[[Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln]]}}
[[File:Mary_Todd_Lincoln.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Todd Lincoln]], wife of Abraham Lincoln]]
On November 4, 1842 Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in [[Springfield, Illinois]] on August 1, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].
The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teenage years. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, also in Springfield. [[William Wallace Lincoln|William &quot;Willie&quot; Wallace Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in [[Washington, D.C.]], during President Lincoln's first term. [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]] was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago. Lincoln's last undisputed lineal descendant, [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died December 24, 1985.
Lincoln was not lucky when it came to women. Having lost his first love, [[Ann Rutledge]], to what could possibly have been typhoid fever, he courted Mary Owens, the sister of his friend Elizabeth Abell, with the promise of marriage. Lincoln finally proposed to Owens in May 1837, but the proposal was less than appealing to her. Eighteen months after that rejection, however, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd. Finally in November 1842, after an eighteen month break in their engagement, they were married in the parlor of the Edwards' mansion. Eventually after their marriage, they settled into a quaint house on Eighth and Jackson in Springfield, which was conveniently located within walking distance of his law office. Mary had a hard time adjusting to her new life because she was used to having slaves perform most of the chores all of her life. Also, because Mary was used to having money her entire life, she struggled with the adjustment to relative poverty. Even though Abraham and Mary struggled with the first couple of years of their marriage, the births of two sons within the first forty months of their marriage helped relieve some of that tension. The Lincolns did not believe in rules and boundaries when it came to their children. They were free and able to do anything they pleased.&lt;ref name=&quot;teamofrivals&quot; /&gt;

==Early political career and military service==
[[Image:Abe Lincoln young.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sketch of a younger Abraham Lincoln]]
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln's early life and career|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]] as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], losing to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Edmund &quot;Dick&quot; Taylor]] (who would become a friend of Lincoln in later years). The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Beardstown and Sangamon Canal|Sangamon River]]. Later that year he served as a captain in a company of the Illinois militia during the Black Hawk War, although he never saw combat. (His horse was stolen in [[Wisconsin]], and he had to return by a combination of hitchhiking, walking, and canoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.il.ngb.army.mil/museum/HistPeople/Lincoln.htm Captain Abraham Lincoln]&lt;/ref&gt;)
 
In 1834, he won an election to the state legislature and, after coming across the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', began to teach himself law. [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois that same year and began to practice law with [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin, who lent Lincoln the law books that sparked his interest in that career path. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer. It is reputed that, had Stuart not lent Lincoln his law books, Lincoln would not have gone into a career in politics. &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1841 Lincoln entered the law practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], a fellow Whig.
He served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837 he made [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery|his first protest against slavery]] in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

===Illinois politics===
[[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1846 or 1847]]
In 1846 Lincoln was elected to one term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. A staunch Whig, Lincoln often referred to party leader [[Henry Clay]] as his political idol. As a freshman House member, Lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in Congress. He used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the [[Mexican–American War|war]] with [[Mexico]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;
Lincoln's most famous stand against Polk was in his [[Spot Resolutions]]: The war had begun with a violent confrontation on disputed territory (claimed by both Mexico and [[Texas]]), but Polk had insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded ''our territory'' shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/Willis/Civil_War/documents/LincolnSpot.html 
|author=Abraham Lincoln
|title=&quot;Spot Resolutions&quot;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed, and proof that that spot was on American soil. Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, and its introduction resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district; one Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;

|title=National Archives: Lincoln's Spot Resolutions}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln was a key early supporter of [[Zachary Taylor]]'s candidacy for the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]]. When Lincoln's term ended, the incoming Taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote [[Oregon Territory]]. Acceptance would end his career in the fast-growing state of Illinois, so he declined. Returning instead to Springfield, Illinois, he turned most of his energies to making a living at the [[bar (law)|bar]], which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county.
It was during this stage of his life, however, that Lincoln gave one of the most pivotal speeches&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
of his life - speaking not as a politician, but as a private citizen. Opposed to the 1854 [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], Lincoln spoke to a crowd in Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, 1854, outlining the moral, political, and economic arguments against slavery&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
that he would continue to uphold throughout his career. This speech marked his re-entry into public life.

===Prairie lawyer===
By the mid-1850s, Lincoln faced competing transportation interests — both the river [[barge]]s and the [[rail transport|railroad]]s. Originally, Lincoln had favored riverboat interests. In 1849, he had received a [[patent]] for a &quot;device to buoy vessels over shoals.&quot;   Lincoln's goal had been to lessen the draft of a river craft by pushing horizontal floats into the water alongside the hull. The floats would have served as temporary [[ballast tank]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAH&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept was never commercialized. Lincoln was the only President of the United States to hold a patent.   
As the 1850s began, Lincoln moved closer towards the railroad industry.   In 1851, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer proposed Alton &amp; Sangamon route was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue Mr. Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.
Lincoln's most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]], a rare tactic at that time, to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a [[Farmers' Almanac]] to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based upon this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.

==Republican politics 1854–1860==
Lincoln returned to politics in response to the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as established by the [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by the national Congress.&lt;ref&gt;

Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil, Liberty, and Democratic party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced, he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat [[Lyman Trumbull]]. At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.
In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]]. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|his famous speech]]: &quot;'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.

===Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858===
{{main|Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858}}
The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[republicanism]], while [[Stephen A. Douglas]] emphasized the supremacy of [[democracy]], as set forth in his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and could overrule judicial rulings. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star. New York party leaders invited him to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] in February 1860 to an elite audience that was startled by the poorly dressed, ugly man from the West. He stunned the audience with the most brilliant political speech they had ever heard. Lincoln was emerging as the intellectual leader of the Republican party, and its best speaker.&lt;ref&gt;
Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression&quot; on a New York audience; Richard Carwardine, ''Lincoln'' (2003), p. 98; Harold Holzer, ''Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President'' (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==1860 Presidential election==
[[Image:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Rail Candidate&quot; - Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by the slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor [[Horace Greeley]]) on right.]]
{{main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
Lincoln was chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]]. His &quot;Western&quot; origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the Civil War Came |author=Boritt, Gabor S. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1997-05-29 |isbn=0195113764 |pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Request quotation|date=June 2008}} On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.
[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|300px|thumb|1860 presidential election results]]
Lincoln did not campaign on the road. Despite this, he had gained the majority of the popular vote due to the work of the local Republican Party offices throughout the north. They produced tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making an emphasis on his childhood poverty. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. In the South, Lincoln did not appear on a majority of the ballots come the time of the election.

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in all of the Southern states. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election. Lincoln was the first U. S. President elected from Illinois.

==Presidency and the Civil War==
{{main|Origins of the American Civil War|Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War}}
With the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West{{ndash}} the focal point of sectional tensions{{ndash}} was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. Yet they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.

===Secession winter 1860–1861===
{{main|Baltimore Plot|Cornerstone Speech}}
As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] took the lead. By February 1, 1861, South Carolina was followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. The upper South ([[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.
Attempts at compromise, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]] which would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri line of 1820]], were discussed. Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln denounced it in private letters, saying &quot;either the Missouri line extended, or... Pop. Sov. would lose us everything we gained in the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

In his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|first inaugural address]], Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,&quot; arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?
Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation.
By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible, Lincoln decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.
Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He &quot;temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis&quot;, overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.&lt;ref&gt;

In connection with Nevins' conclusions, it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Then a civilian, Sherman visited Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week, with his brother, Ohio Republican John Sherman. This meeting left the future General Sherman &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at Lincoln's seeming failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and the South was &quot;preparing for war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

===Fighting begins: 1861–1862===
{{main
|American Civil War}}
In April 1861, after Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. [[Virginia]], which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Arkansas]].
The slave states of [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]] did not secede. Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, [[Clement Vallandigham]], was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (''see'': [[Ex parte Merryman]]).
Lincoln had to protect the nation's capital city. In May, angry secessionist mobs in [[Baltimore]], a city to the north of Washington, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|fought with Union troops traveling south]]. [[George William Brown]], the [[List of mayors of Baltimore, Maryland|Mayor of Baltimore]], and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned at [[Fort McHenry]].
===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{main|Abraham Lincoln on slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}
{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
Lincoln maintained that the powers of his administration to end slavery were limited by the Constitution. He expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any U.S. territory, and by convincing states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] if the state would outlaw slavery (an offer that took effect only in Washington, D.C.). Guelzo says Lincoln believed that shrinking slavery in this way would make it uneconomical, and place it back on the road to eventual extinction that the Founders had envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, Congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which freed the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;
It said that anyone aiding the rebellion would lose his slaves if convicted. &quot;That if any person shall hereafter incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to, any such existing rebellion or insurrection, and be convicted thereof, such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and by the liberation of all his slaves....&quot; {{cite web

|accessdate=2008-12-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. In that same month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.
In a shrewdly penned August reply to an editorial by Horace Greeley in the influential ''New York Tribune'', with a draft of the Proclamation already on Lincoln's desk, the president subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the cause of preserving the Union, while, at the same time, preparing the public for emancipation being incomplete at first. Lincoln had decided at this point that he could not win the war without freeing the slaves, and so it was a necessity &quot;to do more to help the cause&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;
For analysis of the letter see Carwardine, ''Lincoln'' p 209
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be &quot;the Union as it was.&quot;&amp;nbsp;... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced on September 22, 1862 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not already under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate territory (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;

In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], at the Loyal [[War Governors' Conference]] to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General [[George B.

For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As [[Frederick Douglass]] observed, Lincoln was, &quot;The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address===
{{main|Gettysburg Address}}
Although the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was a Union victory, it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln's war effort. As the Union Army decreased in numbers due to casualties, more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks. Lincoln's 1863 military drafts were considered &quot;odious&quot; among many in the north, particularly immigrants. The [[New York Draft Riots]] of July 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent.
Writing to Lincoln in September 1863, the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor of Pennsylvania]], [[Andrew Gregg Curtin]], warned that political sentiments were turning against Lincoln and the war effort:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''If the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful, and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us. The draft is very odious in the State... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion, and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent, and the changes are against us.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-05-21 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d2604300))|title=Andrew G.

''Drawn with the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. p. 185. Google Book Search. Retrieved on November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was delivered at the dedication of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], four and a half months after the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies defeated those of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the decisive [[Battle of Gettysburg]].
Abraham Lincoln's carefully crafted address, secondary to other presentations that day, came to be regarded as one of the greatest speeches in American history. In just over two minutes, Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and redefined the Civil War as a struggle not merely for the [[United States|Union]], but as &quot;a new birth of [[political freedom|freedom]]&quot; that would bring true equality to all of its citizens, and that would also create a unified nation in which [[states' rights]] were no longer dominant.
Beginning with the now-iconic phrase, ''Four [[20 (number)|score]] and seven years ago...'', Lincoln referred to the events of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and described the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to dedicate the living to the struggle to ensure that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.
Despite the speech's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States, the exact wording of the speech is disputed. The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address differ in a number of details and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/pete/planyourvisit/upload/D2%20Site%2021%20Gettysburg%20Address%20Poplar%20Grove.pdf Site 21: Gettysburg Address Poplar Grove]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|United States presidential election, 1864}}
After Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], and [[Chattanooga Campaign|Chattanooga]] in 1863, overall victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted [[Ulysses S. Grant]] General-in-Chief on March 12, 1864. When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected [[Andrew Johnson]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.
[[Image:Lincoln second.jpg|thumb|The only known photographs of Lincoln giving a speech were taken as he delivered his second inaugural address. Here, he stands in the center, with papers in his hand.]]
Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;

Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
While the Democratic platform followed the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party and called the war a &quot;failure,&quot; their candidate, General [[George B. McClellan]], supported the war and repudiated the platform.
[[File:ElectoralCollege1864.svg|300px|1864 Presidential election results|thumb]]
Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] capture of [[Atlanta]] in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but three states.&lt;ref&gt;
There is a good discussion of Lincoln's 1864 election anxieties and the effect of Sherman's victory at Atlanta in James M. McPherson, ''Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief'' (New York: Penguin Press, 2008), 231-50.
&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.

===Conducting the war effort===

Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], and [[Gideon Welles]] take a swing at the Lincoln administration]]
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that [[Washington, D.C.]] was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], with the objective of capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.
McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''Harrison's Landing Letter'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]].&lt;ref&gt;

Panicked by Lee's invasion of [[Maryland]], Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent [[Gettysburg Campaign]] replaced by [[George Meade]].
After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]]. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln replied, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Thomas|1952|p=315}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864 with a strategy of a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. The high casualty figures alarmed the nation and after Grant lost a third of his army Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were. &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,&quot; replied Grant. Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support throughout the North, backed Grant to the hilt, and replaced his losses.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Thomas|1952|p=422-24}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Confederacy was out of replacements so Lee's army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]. In April 1865 Lee's army finally crumbled under Grant's pounding, and Richmond fell.
[[Image:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln, in a [[top hat]], with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at Antietam]]
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure — such as plantations, railroads, and bridges — hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and South Carolina. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln possessed a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and understood the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using [[African American]] troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.
Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by scenes of war. During [[Jubal Anderson Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; a captain shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
The Captain was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]];

===Reconstruction===
{{main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the &quot;moderates&quot; regarding Reconstruction policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in the House and [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Benjamin Wade]] in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were [[Tennessee]], where Lincoln appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as governor, and [[Louisiana]], where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=§20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the war, Lincoln made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and Sherman about ending hostilities (as Sherman managed a hasty visit to Grant from his forces in North Carolina at the same time);&lt;ref&gt;
This meeting was memorialized in G.P.A. Healy's famous painting [http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html &quot;The Peacemakers.&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln also was able to visit Richmond after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis|Jefferson Davis']] own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot; When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

The war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;

===Redefining Republicanism===
Lincoln's [[rhetoric]] defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The [[Gettysburg Address]] defied Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted.
In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], Lincoln shifted emphasis to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the foundation of American political values — what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 399}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential [[Cooper Union speech]], &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Foner|1970|p= 215}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|McPherson|1992|pp=61–64}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a &quot;republican form of government&quot; in every state.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 263}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].
In his [[Gettysburg Address]] Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, &quot;that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of [[sovereignty|state sovereignty]]. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast, they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked &quot;a new founding of the nation.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Wills|1993|p= 39}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
===Civil liberties suspended===
During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a [[Union blockade|blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money before Congress appropriated it, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.
&lt;ref&gt;
Neely (1992)
&lt;/ref&gt;
===Domestic measures===
Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, [[veto]]ing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[university|universities]] in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869. 
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a Federal income tax (which was new). In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]] (the first had become law under [[James Buchanan]]). In 1862, Lincoln signed legislation creating the first U.S. [[income tax]]. Marginal rates were 3% on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and 5% on income above $10,000. (Adjusted for inflation, $600 was the equivalent of $12,325 in 2007 US dollars). In 1864, income-tax rates were raised to 5% on incomes between $600 and $5,000, 7.5% on income between $5,000 and $10,000, and 10% tax on income above that. 
Lincoln also presided over the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. Congress created and Lincoln approved the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.
The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the [[United States Note]], the first [[banknote|paper currency]] in United States history since the [[Continental (currency)|Continentals]] that were issued during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]]. This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.
During the war, Lincoln's [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] effectively controlled all [[cotton]] trade in the occupied South — the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.
In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 [[death warrant]]s for convicted [[Sioux#Isanti (Santee or Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers; Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for [[death penalty|execution]] (one was later [[reprieve]]d).
Abraham Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States. Prior to Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had only been proclaimed by the federal government sporadically, and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation was during [[James Madison|James Madison's]] presidency fifty years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November to be a day of Thanksgiving, and the holiday has been celebrated annually at that time ever since.

[[Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives 2.png|right|thumb|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and [[John Wilkes Booth]]]]
Originally, [[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Learning that the President and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]].
Without his main bodyguard [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play (&quot;You sock-dologizing old man-trap&quot;), hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug 0.44 caliber Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leaped to the stage and shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; ({{lang-la|Thus always to tyrants}}) and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap.

&lt;/ref&gt;
A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.
[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|thumb|left|Lincoln's [[funeral train]] carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son, William, {{convert|1654|mi|km|abbr=off}} to Illinois]]
An army surgeon, Doctor [[Charles Leale]], initially assessed Lincoln's wound as [[Mortal wound|mortal]]. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|U.S. Army Surgeon General]] [[Joseph Barnes|Joseph K. Barnes]] of the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]]. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=off}} inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865. He was the first president to be assassinated or to [[Lying in state|lie in state]].
Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, [[copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant. The [[Lincoln Tomb]] in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is {{convert|177|ft|m|abbr=off}} tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] had it [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.

==Religious and philosophical beliefs==
{{see|Abraham Lincoln and religion}}
In March 1860 in a speech in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.&quot; The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined &quot;seriously as a man of ideas.&quot; Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] version of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalism]] who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=18–19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by &quot;an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.&quot; It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.
&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Miller|2002|pp=57–59}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as a child, Lincoln largely rejected [[religion|organized religion]], but the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as &quot;that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=15}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, &quot;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=514}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:
{{quote|The [[will (philosophy)|will]] of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party—and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose. I am almost ready to say this is probably true—that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Lincoln’s religious [[skepticism]] was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and classical liberalism, especially [[economic liberalism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;/&gt; Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=194}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,
{{quote|I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&amp;nbsp;... It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform of the [[Know Nothing]]s. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=194–195}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the [[Bible]], that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=297}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical history and &quot;melancholy&quot;==
Lincoln suffered from many illnesses throughout his life, including [[frostbite|frostbitten]] feet, [[malaria]], [[physical trauma]] and [[smallpox]].

As a child, Lincoln was tall for his age. He reached his adult height of {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|2}} no later than age 21. Although well muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Fragmentary evidence says he weighed over 200 pounds in his mid-20s, but his official weight upon his taking office as president was 180 pounds, and he is believed to have weighed even less further along in his presidency.

Testing Lincoln's [[DNA]] for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed.
In 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that Lincoln had [[multiple endocrine neoplasia]], type 2B (MEN2B).
&lt;ref&gt;

|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]
|publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems
|year=2008
|url=http://www.physical-lincoln.com/}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body shape, large, bumpy lips, [[constipation]], [[hypotonia]], a history compatible with [[cancer]] and a family history of the disorder - his sons [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]], [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]], and [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]], and probably his mother. The &quot;mole&quot; on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and &quot;pseudo-depression&quot; are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.  Sotos and medical historian [[Jacob Appel]] have recently campaigned to have such testing conducted on a pillowcase stained with Lincoln's blood that is owned by the Grand Army of the Republic Civil War Museum and Library in Philadelphia, an effort that has generated considerable debate among privacy advocates.

Lincoln was regularly reported to suffer from &quot;melancholy&quot;. Some biographers have controversially diagnosed him with [[clinical depression]] and [[bipolar disorder]], but these theories have generally been dismissed.

Mainly, his reported melancholy affected at times of great political stress or warfare and after losing a loved one, neither of which are unusual. He lost the two women (his mother and his sister) he loved very much when he was extremely young. This melancholy was also reinforced later in his life by the losses of his stepmother and his very first love, Ann Rutledge. Mary Lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting and his melancholy also struck at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those he put faith in.

Other people have suggested that he was simply a private person who took solace in solitude. They argue that this can be seen in some of his actions as both a young boy and adult. Some of these actions included withdrawing himself from a crowd to read when he was a little boy, and even retreating to his privacy to find a solution to a problem. As an adult, Lincoln would often slip into depression, and emerge a short time later full of humor and happiness. Some people suggest that Lincoln's humor was actually a healthy way to cope with his depression.
&lt;ref name=&quot;teamofrivals&quot; /&gt;

Unlike the quiet, deep voice later used by impersonators and actors, Lincoln reportedly had a strikingly high-pitched speaking voice which aided him at times when he needed to be heard by crowds of thousands before the existence of microphones. Despite his legendary talent as orator, he was said to have been shy and awkward in intimate social situations, especially in his youth.

[[Image:TheApotheosisLincolnAndWashington1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Apotheosis'' of Abraham Lincoln, greeted by [[George Washington]] in heaven (an 1860s work)]]
Lincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]], often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.
Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]-supporting [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln National Corporation]]. The [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln automobile brand]] is also named after him.

[[Centre College]] named the 2008-09 school year the &quot;Year of Lincoln,&quot; and sponsored several projects and events in which Lincoln (and his connections to Centre College) were celebrated. These included naming a residence hall for Centre alum John Todd Stuart, Lincoln's law partner; bringing journalist [[Mo Rocca]] to Danville to celebrate the Kentucky Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial; hosting a Lincoln symposium; and more. [http://www.centre.edu/lincoln/]

The [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (SSBN-602)]] and the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]] were named in his honor. Also, the [[Liberty ship]] SS ''Nancy Hanks'' was named for his mother. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the American faction of the [[International Brigades]] named themselves the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]].
Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]. [[Lincoln, Illinois]], is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., the U.S. [[United States five-dollar bill|Lincoln $5 bill]] and the [[Lincoln cent]], Lincoln's sculpture on [[Mount Rushmore]], and the [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theatre]], and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in [[Redlands, California]], is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for Illinois is ''Land of Lincoln''; the slogan has appeared continuously on nearly all [[Vehicle registration plates of Illinois|Illinois license plates]] issued since 1954.
[[County (United States)|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as [[Presidents Day (United States)|Presidents Day]]. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, [[Lincoln's Birthday]]. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as Presidents Day as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.  The [[Abraham Lincoln Association]] was formed in 1908 to commemorate the centennial of Lincoln's birth.  The Association is now the oldest group dedicated to the study of Lincoln.
To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission]] (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln's legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an advisory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln's birthplace: [[Hodgenville, Kentucky|Hodgenville]], [[Kentucky]].
Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits. The [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] is located in [[Elwood, Illinois]]. The [http://www.lmunet.edu/museum/Index.html Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum] is located in [[Harrogate, Tennessee]].
On Wednesday 11 March 2009 the [[National Museum of American History]] found a message engraved inside Lincoln's watch by a watchmaker named Jonathan Dillon who was repairing it at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. The engraving reads (in part): &quot;[[Fort Sumpter]] was attacked by the rebels&quot; and &quot;thank God we have a government.&quot;

{{Aristotelianism}}
'''Aristotle''' ({{lang-el|Ἀριστοτέλης}}, ''Aristotélēs'') (384 BC – 322 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] philosopher, a student of [[Plato]] and teacher of [[Alexander the Great]]. He wrote on many subjects, including physics, [[metaphysics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, logic, rhetoric, politics, government, ethics, biology, and zoology. 
Together with Plato and [[Socrates]] (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in [[Western philosophy]]. He was the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics, logic and science, politics and metaphysics.

Aristotle's views on the [[Aristotelian physics|physical sciences]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the [[Renaissance]], although they were ultimately replaced by Newtonian Physics. In the biological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the nineteenth century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late nineteenth century into modern [[formal logic]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] had a profound influence on [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and it continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Eastern Orthodox theology]], and the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. His ethics, though always influent, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.

Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Life==
Aristotle was born in [[Stageira]], [[Chalcidice]], in 384 BC, about {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}} east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aristotle: The Dancing Queen, The Great Philosophers | author = McLeish, Kenneth | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-92392-1 | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the [[aristocracy]]. At about the age of eighteen, he went to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years, not leaving until after Plato's death in 347 BC. He then traveled with [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) [[Pythias]]. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great]] in 343 B.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell, &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle]]
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|Aristotle portrayed in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' as a 15th-century-A.D. scholar]]
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]]. In his ''Politics'', Aristotle states that only one thing could justify monarchy, and that was if the virtue of the king and his family were greater than the virtue of the rest of the citizens put together. Tactfully, he included the young prince and his father in that category. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be 'a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.58-59&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of Alexander's life he began to suspect plots, and threatened Aristotle in letters. Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity, and the king had executed Aristotle's grandnephew [[Callisthenes]] as a traitor. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.379,459&lt;/ref&gt;

By 335 BC he had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of [[Stageira]], who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. 3, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is during this period in Athens from 335 B.C. to 323 B.C. when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt; Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, economics, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared. [[Eurymedon the hierophant]] denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor. Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis]], explaining, &quot;I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, he died in Euboea of natural causes within the year (in 322 BC). Aristotle named chief executor his student [[Antipater]] and left a [[Will (law)|will]] in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt by Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang

==Logic==
{{main|Term logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}

With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of [[formal logic]], and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in [[mathematical logic]]. [[Kant]] stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference.
===History===
Aristotle &quot;says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Bocheński
 | first =I. M.
 | title =Ancient Formal Logic
 | publisher =North-Holland Publishing Company
 | year =1951
 | location =Amsterdam
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was devised before him, by [[Prodicus of Ceos]], who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deduction]] system, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Analytics and the ''Organon''===
{{main|Organon}}
What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in the ''peri hermeneias'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). The fisrt three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the [[langage of logic]] and the correctness rules of reasonings.  There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;/&gt;

==Aristotle's scientific method==
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]''&lt;!-- this should link to an article about the famous artwork --&gt;, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].]]
{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle, however, found the universal in [[particular]] things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, [[mathematics]] and metaphysics.

If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics, Mathematics, (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the sixteenth century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.
[[Image:Perseid Meteor.jpg|thumb|A green and red [[Perseids|Perseid]] meteor is striking the sky.]]
His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' he said the female is as it were a deformed male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=Generation of animals|first=1943|date=1953|publisher=Harvard University Press via Google Books|other=Arthur Leslie Peck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's [[scientific method]] assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 1500s. From the 3rd century to the 1500s, the dominant view held that the Earth was the center of the universe ([[geocentrism]]).

Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place; the earth at the centre of the universe, then water, then air, then fire. When they are out of their natural place they have natural motion, requiring no external cause, which is towards that place; so bodies sink in water, air bubbles rise up, rain falls, flame rises in air. The heavenly element has perpetual circular motion.

===Causality, The Four Causes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Retrocausality]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Four causes}}
*[[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino. 
*The [[formal cause]] tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put the formal cause according to which a statue or a domino, is made is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A more simple example of the formal cause is the blueprint or plan that one has before making or causing a human made object to exist. 

*The [[efficient cause]] is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that which immediately sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over. This is effectively efficient cause.
*The [[final cause]] is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, and all that gives purpose to behavior.

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.

All further investigations of causality will consist of imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, such as final &gt; efficient &gt; material &gt; formal ([[Thomas Aquinas]]), or of restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).

===Optics===
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The earliest known written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[diaphragm]]. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the tiny hole and the surface with the image increased, the image was amplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lahanas |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |publisher=Mlahanas.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chance and spontaneity===
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==
[[Image:Uni Freiburg - Philosophen 4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aristotle (1915) by Cipri Adolf Bermann at the [[University of Freiburg]] [[Freiburg im Breisgau|im Breisgau]]]]
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of abstraction.&quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;

===Substance, potentiality and actuality===
{{seealso|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle examines the concept of substance and essence (''[[ousia]]'') in his ''Metaphysics'', Book VII and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the [[Material substratum|substratum]] or the stuff of which it is composed, ''e.g.'' the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house. While the form of the substance, is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10-30&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the change (''[[kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from: 1) growth and diminution, which is change in quantity; 2) locomotion, which is change in space; and 3) alteration, which is change in quality.

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''[[poiein]]'') or 'be acted upon' (''[[paschein]]''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate - being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise - acting).

Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that actuality is when the seed of the plant becomes a plant.

&quot; For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, the matter of the house is its potentiality and the form is its actuality. The [[formal cause]] (''aitia'') then of that change from potential to actual house, is the [[reason]] (''logos'') of the house builder and the [[final cause]] is the end, namely the house itself. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.

With this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, ''e.g.'', what is that makes the man one? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a-b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universals and particulars===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.

Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a contemporary philosopher that agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.

Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.

One way for contemporary philosophers to justify this position is by asserting the [[eleatic]] principle.

In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.

==Biology and medicine==
In Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals, but not humans and his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

===Empirical research program===
[[Image:Octo2.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]
[[Image:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']]
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''[[Octopus]]'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the nineteenth century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]

Another good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.

He gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of living things===
Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the nineteenth century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[haemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).

For [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;/&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae''), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[formal cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had a multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201-202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.

Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.

He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successor: Theophrastus===
[[Image:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC]]
{{main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum}}
Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany—the ''[[Historia Plantarum|History of Plants]]''—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.

Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Hellenistic medicine===
{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-94; quotation from p 91&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical philosophy==
===Ethics===
{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical science, i.e., one mastered by doing rather than merely reasoning. Further, Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (such as metaphysics or [[epistemology]]) but is general knowledge. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, ''[[Nichomachean Ethics]]'', in which he outlines what is commonly called [[virtue ethics]].

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that man must have a function uncommon to anything else, and that this function must be an activity of the soul. Aristotle identified the best activity of the soul as [[eudaimonia]]: a happiness or joy that pervades the good life. Aristotle taught that to achieve the good life, one must live a balanced life and avoid excess. This balance, he taught, varies among different persons and situations, and exists as a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] between two vices - one an excess and one a deficiency.

===Politics===
{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan | coauthors =William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | page =59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior to the [[family]] which in turn is prior to the individual, i.e., last in the order of becoming, but first in the order of being &lt;!-- (1253a19-24) --&gt;. He is also famous for his statement that &quot;man is by nature a political animal.&quot; Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a [[machine]], and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others.

It should be noted that the modern understanding of a political community is that of the state. However, the state was foreign to Aristotle. He referred to political communities as cities. Aristotle understood a city as a political &quot;partnership&quot; &lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt; and not one of a [[social contract]] (or compact) or a political community as understood by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. Subsequently, a city is created not to avoid injustice or for economic stability &lt;!-- (1280b29-31) --&gt;, but rather to live a good life: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&quot; &lt;!-- (1281a1-3) --&gt;. This can be distinguished from the social contract theory which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomacean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78-115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetoric and poetics===
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by media, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation - through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books - one on comedy and one on tragedy - only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998. ISBN 0140446494 Cf. Introduction, pp. xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of his works==
According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;exoteric&quot; and the &quot;esoteric&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself: ''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1102a26-27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408-410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic]] school&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works (esoteric) intended for the narrower audience of Aristotle's students and other philosophers who were familiar with the jargon and issues typical of the Platonic and Aristotelian schools. Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant - that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us?&lt;ref&gt;The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor [[Theophrastus]], who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the first century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].

[[Carnes Lord]] attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.

As the influence of the ''falsafa'' grew in the West, in part due to [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translations and the spread of [[Averroism]], the demand for Aristotle's works grew. [[William of Moerbeke]] translated a number of them into Latin. When [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his [[theology]], working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in [[Europe]], and ultimately revitalizing European thought through Muslim influence in Spain to fan the embers of the Renaissance.

==Legacy==
Twenty-three hundred years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He was the founder of [[formal logic]], pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle |title=Aristotle (Greek philosopher) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. |location=[[United States]] |isbn=9780671739164 |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these accolades, many of Aristotle's errors held back science considerably. [[Bertrand Russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;  Of course, the problem of excessive devotion to Aristotle is more a problem of those later centuries and not of Aristotle himself.

The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle is referred to as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'' at his beddes heed'' 
:''Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,''
:''Of aristotle and his philosophie,''&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295-295&lt;/ref&gt;
The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],
:''I saw the Master there of those who know,''
:''Amid the philosophic family,''
:''By all admired, and by all reverenced;''
:''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,''
:''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''&lt;ref&gt;''vidi ’l maestro di color che sanno''
''seder tra filosofica famiglia.''&lt;/br&gt;
''Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno'':&lt;/br&gt;
''quivi vid’ïo Socrate e Platone''&lt;/br&gt;
''che ’nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;''&lt;/br&gt; Dante, ''L’Inferno'' (Hell), Canto IV. Lines  131-135&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed that women are colder than men and thus a lower form of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lovejoy, Arthur|title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=first|date=1964|isbn=0674361539}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assumption carried forward unexamined to [[Galen]] and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Tuana&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuana, Nancy|title=The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Women's Nature|date=1993|pages=21, 169|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-36098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that females could not be fully human.&lt;ref&gt;Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'' p. 19, and footnote 8 p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a [[Misogyny|misogynist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On the other hand, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too. In places like Sparta where the lot of women is bad, there can only be half-happiness in society.(see Rhetoric 1.5.6)

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue - or ''arete'' - of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">: ''This article is about the Gershwin composition. For the 1951 musical starring Gene Kelly, see [[An American in Paris (film)]].''
 
'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[European-influenced classical music|symphonic]] composition by American composer [[George Gershwin]], composed in 1928. Inspired by time Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]], it is in the form of an extended [[tone poem]] evoking the sights and energy of the [[France|French]] capital in the 1920s. It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions.

Gershwin composed the piece on commission from the [[New York Philharmonic]]. He also did the [[orchestration]]. (He did not orchestrate his musicals.) Gershwin scored ''An American in Paris'' for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]], and automobile horns. Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the [[New York City|New York]] premiere of the composition which took place on December 13, 1928 in [[Carnegie Hall]] with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the New York Philharmonic.

Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot; When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], &quot;our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness.&quot; But, &quot;nostalgia is not a fatal disease.&quot; The American visitor &quot;once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life&quot; and &quot;the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant.&quot;

== Instrumentation ==
''An American in Paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in B flat, [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 taxi horns, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], and [[String section|strings]].

== Recordings ==
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded over the years.  The very first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].  Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.  Later, [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.

In 1951, MGM released a musical comedy, ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winner of numerous awards, including the 1951 Best Picture Oscar, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around Gershwin's symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green).

A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', released in 1997.

The '''Academy Awards''', popularly known as the '''Oscars''', are presented annually by the American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title = About the Academy Awards |publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize excellence of professionals in the [[film industry]], including [[Film director|directors]], [[actors]], and [[writers]]. The formal [[ceremony]] at which the [[awards]] are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media, and many other award ceremonies such as the [[Grammy Awards]] (for music), [[Golden Globe Awards]] (all forms of media), and [[Emmy Awards]] (for television) are often modeled from the Academy.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences itself was conceived by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]].

The [[1st Academy Awards]] ceremony was held Thursday, May 16, 1929, at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927 and 1928. It was hosted by actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and director [[William C. deMille]].  The [[81st Academy Awards]], honoring the best [[2008 in film|in film for 2008]], was held on Sunday, February 22, 2009, at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], with actor [[Hugh Jackman]] hosting the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2008/08.12.12.html Retrieved 2009-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner in Hollywood with an audience of fewer than 1,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;about2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index2.html|title=About the Academy Awards &lt;small&gt;(page 2)&lt;/small&gt;|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first year, the awards have been publicly broadcast, at first by radio then by TV after 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;about2&quot;/&gt; During the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 p.m. on the night of the awards. This method was ruined when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the awards have been broadcast from the [[Kodak Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

==Oscar statuette==
===Design===
[[Image:Academy Award Oscar (cropped).JPG|thumb|widthpx|The Oscar statuette featured in a display case.]]

The official name of the Oscar [[statuette]] is the ''Academy Award of Merit''. Made of [[gold]]-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a [[knight]] rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusade|crusader's]] [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscar.com/legacy/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on a scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican film director [[Emilio Fernandez|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;. Then, sculptor George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm | title=Muse Fountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent [[copper]] and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes for Golnaz Rahimi. Since 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html#photo14| title=Eladio Gonzalez sands and buffs Oscar #3453| work=The Big Picture| publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]| date=February 20, 2009| accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in [[Chicago, Illinois]] by manufacturer [[R.S. Owens &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Don |last=Babwin |title=Oscar 3453 is 'born' in Chicago factory |work=Associated Press |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jL1cVq-oMS6qeuUPUWfAQpf85fewD95V3MV80
|date=2009-01-27 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5e8JdSe3B |archivedate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In support of the American effort in [[World War II]], the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2|title= Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming ===
The root of the name ''Oscar'' is contested.  One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher= The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[TIME Magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html &quot;Oscars&quot;], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; and to Bette Davis's receipt of the award in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://firstmention.com/oscars.aspx|title= The Oscars, 1936|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that of the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, who first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette reminding her of her &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar&quot; in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2008 Draft Revision.&lt;/ref&gt;. Columnist Qiang Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot; (Levy 2003). The trophy was officially dubbed the &quot;Oscar&quot; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette|title=OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of the [[81st Academy Awards]] ceremony held in 2009, a total of 2,744 Oscars have been given for 1,798 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/index.html|title= A Brief History of the Oscar|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 297 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums (Levy 2003, pg 28).

This rule is highly controversial, since while the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.forbes.com/2005/02/28/cx_lr_0228oscarsales.html
   |title      = Psst! Wanna Buy An Oscar? 
   |publisher  = forbes
   |author     = Lacey Rose
   |date=        28 Feb 2005
   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The case of [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s grandson trying to sell Todd's Oscar statuette illustrates that there are many who do not agree with this idea. When Todd's grandson attempted to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector, the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, the buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury (Levy 2003, pg 29).

==Nomination==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to 2004, nomination results were announced publicly in early February.

===Voters===
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,835 as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=2008-01-30 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url = http://news. bbc. co. uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm|title = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher = BBC News|author = Jackie Finlay|date= 2006–03–03|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually.The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www. oscars. org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
Today, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html
   |title      = Rule Two: Eligibility
   |publisher  = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 2 states that a film must be &quot;feature-length&quot;, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280x720]].

The members of the prince various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule05.html

   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[79th Academy Awards]], 847 members (past and present) of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] have been nominated for an Oscar (in all categories).

==Ceremony==

[[Image:81st Academy Awards Ceremony.JPG|thumb|300px|81st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Hollywood and Highland]], Hollywood, 2009]]

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent [[fashion]] designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)

The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher = Oscars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html Nielsen - Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources. The usual extension of this claim is that only the [[Super Bowl]], [[Olympics]] Opening Ceremonies, and [[FIFA World Cup]] Final draw higher viewership.

The Awards show was first televised on [[NBC]] in 1953. [[NBC]] continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which [[NBC]] resumed the broadcasts. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

After more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[Nielsen Ratings#&quot;Sweeps&quot;|sweeps]] period. (The ceremony was moved into early March during 2006, in deference to the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 38 wins and 167 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Ratings===
Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast in [[70th Academy Awards|1998]], the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html Business &amp; Technology | Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | Seattle Times Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=January 26, 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by ''Variety'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party | publisher = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another low-budget, independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

==Venues==
The [[1st Academy Awards]] were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].

[[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at the Academy's then-headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]]. The Oscars then moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in the [[Los Angeles Music Center]].

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Kodak Theatre]] became the first permanent home of the awards. It is connected to the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood &amp; Highland Center]], which contains &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;640,000&amp;nbsp;square feet&amp;nbsp;(59,000&amp;nbsp;m²)&lt;/span&gt; of space including retail, restaurants, nightclubs, other establishments and a six-screen cinema. 

These are the locations at which the awards were presented over the years.

==Criticism==
The Academy Awards are not without criticism.  The Oscars are generally voted on by members of the entertainment industry; thus, important films that have had the most people working on them generally become nominated.  Director [[William Friedkin]], an Oscar winner and producer of the Academy Awards, spoke critically of the awards at a conference in New York in 2009.  He characterized the Academy Awards as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date2=2009-02-24 |title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars.  The first to do so was [[Dudley Nichols]] ([[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Writing]] in [[1935 in film|1935]] for ''[[The Informer (film)|The Informer]]'').  Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writer's Guild.&lt;ref name=DYK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp|title=The Oscars Did You Know?|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in [[1970 in film|1970]] for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''), at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony.  Scott explained, &quot;The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade.  I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm BBC News obituary], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html TIME archives]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp]  The third winner, [[Marlon Brando]], refused his award ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in [[1972 in film|1972]] for ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.  At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech detailing Brando's criticisms.&lt;ref name=DYK/&gt;

'''''Actrius''''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Actresses'') is a [[1996 in film|1996 film]] directed by [[Ventura Pons]]. In the film, there are no male actors and the four leading actresses dubbed themselves in the Castilian version.

==Synopsis==
In order to prepare the role of an important old actress, a theatre student interviews three actresses who were her pupils: an international diva (Glòria Marc, played by [[Núria Espert]]), a television star (Assumpta Roca, played by [[Rosa Maria Sardà]]) and a dubbing director (Maria Caminal, played by [[Anna Lizaran]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Animalia.jpg|thumb|240px|Animalia cover]]'''''Animalia''''' (ISBN 0810918684) is an illustrated [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Graeme Base]].  It was published in 1986.  

''Animalia'' is an [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words.  The illustrations contain dozens of small objects that the curious reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture. In 1987, ''Animalia'' won the title of Honour Book in the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] Picture Book of the Year Awards. In 1996, a tenth anniversary edition was released.

Base also published a [[colouring book]] version [http://www.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?qwork=7937230&amp;wauth=Base%2C%20Graeme&amp;matches=16&amp;qsort=r&amp;cm_re=works*listing*title] for children to do their own colouring.

A [[Animalia (TV series)|television series]] was also created, based on the book, which airs in the United States, Australia, Canada, the UK and Norway. It also airs on Minimax for the Czech and Slovak Republics.

'''International Atomic Time''' ('''[http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html TAI]''', from the [[French language|French]] name '''Temps Atomique International''') is a high-precision atomic [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].  It is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]], and the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. {{As of|2009}}, TAI was exactly 34 seconds ahead of UTC: an initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 24 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972 (the last leap second was added on December 31, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;tai-utc.dat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat |title=History of TAI−UTC |publisher=Time Service Dept., [[United States Naval Observatory|U.S. Naval Observatory]] |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin C 36&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Gambis | first = Daniel | title = Bulletin C 36 | publisher =  [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS EOP PC]], [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] | location = [[Paris]] | date = [[2008-07-04]] | url = http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.36 | accessdate = 2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

==Operation==

TAI as a [[frequency]] standard is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 [[atomic clock]]s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using satellites (see [http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/clock_comparisons.html BIPM clock comparisons]).  Many of these are [[caesium]] atomic clocks, which are the standard by which the [[SI]] [[second]] is defined.  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone.

The participating institutions each broadcast, in real time (in the [[present]]), a frequency signal with [[time code]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC. The better laboratories' signals are mutually synchronised to within less than 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; s, but there are outliers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; s out.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''TAI(NPL)'' (''UTC(NPL)'' for the UTC form), where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  Some laboratories also publish their own atomic time scale, denoted in the form ''TA(USNO)'' (''USNO'' identifies the [[United States Naval Observatory]]).

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(x) and TAI-TA(x), for each participating institution x.

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

==History==

Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL).  The first formalised atomic time scale was the ''A.1'' scale defined by USNO in 1959.  A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) at the [[UT2]] instant JD 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) as calculated at USNO.  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several [[centisecond]]s.  A.1 was extrapolated backwards to 1956.

In 1961, the [[Bureau International de l'Heure]] (BIH) (later superseded by the BIPM and the IERS) constructed an atomic time scale named ''AM'' based on three atomic clocks.  The clocks were compared by listening to radio [[time signal]]s based on them.  The BIH's time scale was synchronised with A.1's epoch, and extrapolated back to 1955 using time signals from the first caesium clock at NPL.  This time scale was soon renamed from AM to ''A3''.

Also in 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximates [[UT1]].  This was a [[compromise]] arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.

In 1967 the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock.

More clocks were added to the A3 time scale from 1967, and it was renamed to ''TA''.  Finally in 1971 it was renamed ''TAI''.

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the [[altitude]]s of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1977-01-01T00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.

In the 1990s, annual periodic variations in the rate of some clocks were traced to [[blackbody radiation]] that varies with the ambient [[temperature]].  It became clear that a correction for this was required.  Accordingly, in 1997 the BIPM declared that the definition of the SI second referred to a caesium atom at rest and at [[absolute zero]] temperature.  Temperature corrections were implemented in TAI from 1995 to 1998, speeding TAI up by about 10&lt;sup&gt;-14.3&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{for|the ethical doctrine|Altruism (ethics)}}

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altrustic action in many cultures and religions.]]
'''Altruism''' (from {{lang-la|alter}}: the other) is the deliberate pursuit of the interests or [[welfare]] of others or the public interest.

==The notion of altruism==

The concept has a long history in [[philosophical]] and [[ethical]] thought, and has more recently become a topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[sociologists]], [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. While ideas about '''altruism''' from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism.

==Scientific viewpoints==
====Ethology====
{{main|Altruism in animals|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name=Bell2008&gt;{{Citation

 | location = Oxford
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers on alleged altruist behaviours among animals have been ideologically opposed to the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] concept of the &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;, under the name of &quot;survival of the nicest&quot;&amp;mdash;the latter not being globally compatible, however, with [[Darwinism|Darwin's]] [[theory of evolution]]. Insistence on such cooperative behaviours between animals was first exposed by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]''.

Recent developments in [[game theory]] (see [[ultimatum game]]) have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:

* Behavioural manipulation (for example, by certain [[parasites]] that can alter the behavior of the host)
* [[Bounded rationality]] (for example, [[Herbert Simon]])
* [[Conscience]]
* [[Kin selection]] including [[eusociality]] (see also &quot;[[selfish gene]]&quot;)
* [[Meme]]s (by influencing behaviour to favour their own spread, for example, [[religion]])
* [[Reciprocal altruism]], mutual aid
* Selective investment theory&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S.L. &amp; Brown, R.M. (2006).

* [[Sexual selection]], in particular, the [[Handicap principle]]
* [[Reciprocity (social psychology)]]
** Indirect reciprocity (for example, [[reputation]])
** Strong reciprocity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pseudo-reciprocity

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]] which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similarities to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.

====Neurology====

Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623-15628)&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed their interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|title=If It Feels Good to Be Good, It Might Be Only Natural
|publisher=Washington Post
|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetics====

A new study by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in [[New Mexico]], US, is seen by some as breathing new life into the model of [[group selection]] for Altruism, known as &quot;Survival of the nicest&quot;. Bowles conducted a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups, including [[Australian aboriginals]], native [[Siberian]] [[Inuit]] populations and indigenous tribal groups in Africa. It was found that [[hunter-gatherer]] bands of up to 30 individuals were considerably more closely related than was previously thought. Under these conditions, thought to be similar to those of the middle and upper [[Paleolithic]], altruism towards other group-members would improve the overall fitness of the group. 

If an individual defended the group but was killed, any genes that the individual shared with the overall group would still be passed on. Early customs such as food sharing or [[monogamy]] could have levelled out the “cost” of altruistic behaviour, in the same way that income taxes redistribute income in society. He assembled genetic, climactic, archaeological, ethnographic and experimental data to examine the cost-benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations. In his model, members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour pay a &quot;tax&quot; by limiting their reproductive opportunities to benefit from sharing food and information, thereby increasing the average fitness of the group as well as their inter-relatedness. Bands of altruistic humans would then act together to gain resources from other groups at this challenging time in history.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Richard (7 December 2006) &quot;Why altruism paid off for our ancestors&quot; (NewScientist.com news service) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10750.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruist theories in evolutionary biology were contested by [[Amotz Zahavi]], the inventor of the signal theory and its correlative, the [[handicap principle]], based mainly on his observations of the [[Arabian Babbler]], a bird commonly known for its surprising (alleged) altruistic behaviours.

==Religious viewpoints==
{{see also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]], etc, place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

====Christianity====

Altruism was central to the teachings of [[Jesus]] found in the [[Gospel]] especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love,&quot; as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception'', Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. If love, which confirms others in their freedom, shuns propagandas and masks, assurance of its presence is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love become validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the doing.

Though it might seem obvious that altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus, one important and influential strand of Christianity would qualify this. [[St Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', I:II Quaestion 26, Article 4 states that we should love ourselves more than our neighbour. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual. 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from [[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22 is interpreted by St Thomas as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. He does think though, that we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbour, taken as an entirety, more than our bodily life, since the ultimate purpose of love of our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude, a more desirable thing than bodily well being. Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, now part of mainstream Catholicism, in coining the word Altruism, as stated above.

[[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. And altruistic action is not always loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the good of the other, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the demands of the other undermine overall well-being.

====Sikhism====
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. In the late 1600s, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.
&quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,&quot; replied Bhai Kanhaiya. 
The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot; 

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Kabbalah====

Kabbalah defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The Kabbalist Rav [[Abraham Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kook | first = Abraham Isaac | authorlink = | coauthors = Ben Zion Bokser | title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems | publisher = Paulist Press | date = 1978 | location = | pages = 135-136 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780809121595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or [[God]]. Kabbalah defines [[God]] as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the ‘purpose of creation’ and how the will of [[God]] was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Luzzatto | first = Moshe Ḥayyim | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The way of God | publisher = Feldheim Publishers | date = 1997 | location = | pages = 37-38 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780873067690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashlag | first = Yehuda | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Building the Future Society | publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers | date = 2006 | location = Thornhill, Canada | pages = 120-130 | url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main | doi = | id = | isbn = 9657065348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashlag | first = Yehuda | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Building the Future Society | publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers | date = 2006 | location = Thornhill, Canada | pages = 175-180 | url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main | doi = | id = | isbn = 9657065348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sufism====

In [[Sufism]], the concept of [[I’thar]] is the notion of ‘preferring others to oneself’. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing i'thar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | isbn = 1932099751
 | publisher = Fountain
 | location = Rutherford, N.J.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike the European concept there is a focus on attention to everything in existence. A constant concern for [[Allah]] results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=Neusner2005&gt;{{Citation

 | isbn = 1589010655
 | publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press
 | location = Washington, D.C.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufi mystics like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference in dedication to Allah and dedication to people.

====Buddhism====
 
{{Main| Karma in Buddhism}}
In Buddhism, ''karma'' (Pāli ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from '''''[[vipaka|vipāka]]''''', meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;. Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli ''hetu'') in the [[Twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of &quot;volitional activities&quot; (Pali ''sankhara'') and &quot;action&quot; (Pali ''bhava''). Any action is understood to create &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that will sprout into the appropriate result (Pāli ''vipaka'') when they meet with the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one within the wheel of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirvāna]]. 

Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but included in the motivation is also the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be &quot;bad&quot; in the sense that it creates unpleasant results for the &quot;actor&quot;.

In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of everything that happens. The commentarial tradition classifed causal mechanisms governing the universe as taught in the early texts in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids]], ''Buddhism.'' Reprint by Read Books, 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LljcZ_LBeL0C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Bija+Niyama&amp;lr=].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, ''Environmental philosophy and ethics in Buddhism.'' Macmillan, 1998, page 41. [http://books.google.com/books?id=M4T3C6ndfZIC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Bija+Niyama#PPA41,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kamma Niyama  — Consequences of one's actions
* Utu Niyama  — Seasonal changes and climate
* Biija Niyama  — Laws of heredity
* Citta Niyama — Will of mind
* Dhamma Niyama — Nature's tendency to produce a perfect type

====Vedanta====

[[Vedanta]] disagree with the [[Buddhist]] views, [[Jain]] views and other Hindu views that karma is merely a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme God.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is known for her best-selling novels and for developing a philosophical system called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].
&lt;!-- Biographical details --&gt;
Born and educated in Russia, Rand emigrated to the United States in 1926. She worked as a screenwriter in [[Hollywood]] and had a play produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935-1936. She first achieved fame with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beetz |first=Kirk |title=Beacham's Encyclopedia of Popular Fiction |publisher=Beacham Pub |location=Osprey, Florida |year=1996 |isbn=0-933833-41-5 |page=1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her best-known work – the [[philosophical novel]] ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' – was published in 1957.

&lt;!-- Philosophical views --&gt;
Rand's political views, reflected in both her fiction and her theoretical work, emphasize [[individual rights]] (including property rights) and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]], enforced by [[constitution]]ally limited government. She was a fierce opponent of all forms of [[collectivism]] and [[statism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=Collectivism means the subjugation of the individual to a group—whether to a race, class or state does not matter.

==Early life==
[[Image:Twelvecollegia.jpg|thumb|right|Rand completed a three-year program in the department of social pedagogy at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]].]] 
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|Алиса Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}) in 1905, into a middle-class family living in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. She was the eldest of the three daughters (Alisa, Natasha, and Nora) of Zinovy Zacharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum, largely non-observant [[Jew]]s. Her father was a [[chemist]] and a successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand was twelve at the time of the [[Russian revolution of 1917]]. Opposed to the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]], Rand's sympathies were with [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Rand's family life was disrupted by the rise of the [[Bolshevik]] party. Her father's pharmacy was confiscated by the Soviets, and the family temporarily fled to the [[Crimea]]. At sixteen, Rand returned with her family to Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She enrolled at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]], where she studied in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history.&lt;ref name=Sciabarra&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm |title=The Rand Transcript&quot; |journal=The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=1999 |month=Fall |pages=1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was while at university that she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], who would form two of the greatest influences and counter-influences respectively on her thought.&lt;ref name=Sciabarra/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451-460}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17-18, 22-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her formal study of philosophy amounted to only a few courses, and outside of these three philosophers, her study of key figures was limited to excerpts and summaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciabarra 1995 p=12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the writers she read at this time, [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] became her perennial favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a &quot;non-proletarian,&quot; Rand was &quot;purged&quot; from the university shortly before completing. However, bowing to pressure from foreign intellectuals, the communists relented and allowed many of the expelled students to complete their work and graduate,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Rand did in 1924.&lt;ref name=Sciabarra/&gt; She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Russian Writings on Hollywood |chapter=Introduction |year=1999 |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-last=Berliner |others=Ayn Rand, trans. by Dina Garmong |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute Press |isbn=0-9625336-3-7 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1925, she was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives. She arrived in the United States on February 19, 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; entering by ship through [[New York City]]. After a brief stay with her relatives in [[Chicago]], she resolved never to return to the Soviet Union, and set out for [[Hollywood]] to become a screenwriter. While still in Russia she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as a [[Cyrillic]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of her birth surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=faq_index#ar_q3b |title=What is the origin of “Rand”? |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'' from a Finnish name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, she struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to a job as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in his film, ''[[The King of Kings]],'' and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34-36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While working on ''The King of Kings'', she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor, who caught her eye. The two married on April 15, 1929. Rand became an [[Naturalization|American citizen]] in 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, for a time Rand worked as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35-40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early fiction==
{{Main|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' in 1932 to [[Universal Studios]]. [[Josef Von Sternberg]] considered it for [[Marlene Dietrich]], but anti-Soviet themes were unpopular at the time, and the project came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the [[courtroom drama]] ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced in Hollywood in 1934, and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night the &quot;jury&quot; was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's &quot;verdict,&quot; would then be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|pp=3-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a movie version of the play. She did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fountainheads: Wright, Rand, the FBI and Hollywood |last=Johnson |first=Donald Leslie |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |year=2005 |isbn=0-7864-1958-X |pages=55-56}} ''cf''. {{harvnb|Rand|1971|pp=13-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936 by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]. Set in Communist Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In the foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We The Living'' &quot;is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Foreword |title=We The Living |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |page=xviii |isbn=0-525-94054-5 |edition=60th Anniversary |year=1995 |origyear=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without Rand's knowledge or permission, ''[[We the Living]]'' was made into a pair of films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira'' in [[Italy]] in 1942. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was published in England in  1938, and in America seven years later. It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even [[Personal pronoun|the word &quot;I&quot;]] has vanished from the language and from humanity's memory.

==''The Fountainhead'' and political activism==
{{Also|The Fountainhead|The Fountainhead (film)}}
During the 1940s, Rand became involved in political activism. Both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the 1940 Presidential campaign of [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from the audience &quot;following pro-Willkie newsreels at a Union square movie theater&quot; in [[New York City]], an experience she greatly enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Both men expressed an admiration for Rand, and despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188-189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first major success as a writer came with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943, a romantic drama and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61-78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on an uncompromising young [[architect]] named [[Howard Roark]], and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot;second-handers&quot; — those who attempt to live through others, placing others above self. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58-61}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Fountainhead'' eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. {{asof|April 2008}}, it had sold over 6.5 million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sales of Ayn Rand Books Reach 25 million Copies |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=17345&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1221 |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-31 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Rand returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay for a [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] of ''The Fountainhead'' for [[Warner Brothers]], and the following year she and her husband purchased a home designed by modernist [[Richard Neutra]] and an adjoining ranch. There, Rand entertained figures such as Hazlitt, [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Gilbert Adrian]] and [[Leonard Read]]. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor, and her work for Wallis included the Oscar-nominated [[Love Letters (1945 film)|''Love Letters'']] and ''[[You Came Along]]'', along with research for a screenplay based on the development of the [[Nuclear Weapon|atomic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68-80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183-198}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including the publication of her first work of non-fiction, an essay titled &quot;The Only Path to Tomorrow,&quot; in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in {{cite book |first=Ayn |last=Rand |title=[[The Ayn Rand Column]] |publisher=Second Renaissance Books |location=Oceanside, California |year=1991 |isbn=1-56114-099-6 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Schwartz |editor-link=Peter Schwartz (writer) |pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Rand also outlined and took extensive notes for a non-fiction treatment of her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pp=243–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Rand developed a relationship with [[libertarianism|libertarian]] writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. The two women became friends and philosophical sparring-partners, and Rand is reported to have questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings. Later, the two women had a falling out after what Rand saw as Paterson's bitter and insensitive comments during one of her Hollywood parties. Paterson's influence on Rand's later political theories has been a matter of ongoing debate, but Paterson biographer [[Stephen D. Cox]] credits Rand's public advocacy with keeping her old friend's political work ''[[The God of the Machine]]'' in print for many years, despite their previous break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Stephen |title=The Woman and the Dynamo |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Transaction |year=2004 |isbn=0-7658-0241-4 |pages=218-222, 287-289, 302-314 and 357-359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the [[United States]] [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony regarded the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|pp=91-93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union and portrayed life in the USSR as being much better and happier than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=12 Ayn Rand's HUAC Testimony]&quot; in {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|pp=188-189}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations after the hearings, Rand described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she &quot;disliked the movie from beginning to end,&quot; complaining about its editing, acting and other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Atlas Shrugged'' and later years==
{{Objectivist movement}}{{Main|Atlas Shrugged|Objectivist movement}}
After the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom had been profoundly influenced by the novel. In 1951 Rand moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]], where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated &quot;The Collective&quot;) included future [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the much younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=256–264, 331–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was Rand's ''[[magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=704}} &quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' was the climax and completion of the goal I had set for myself at the age of nine. It expressed everything that I wanted of fiction writing.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the novel is &quot;the role of the mind in man's existence&amp;mdash;and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of [[rational self-interest]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=For the New Intellectual |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists and artists go on [[strike action|strike]] and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent [[Free market|free economy]]. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the &quot;minds&quot; that Rand saw as contributing the most to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and [[science fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.

''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller. Rand's last work of fiction, it marked a turning point in her life, ending her career as novelist and beginning her tenure as a popular philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Younkins |first=Edward |title=Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |year=2007 |isbn=0-7546-5549-0 |chapter=Preface |page=1 |quote=''Atlas Shrugged'' … is the demarcation work and turning point that culminated [Rand's] career as a novelist and propelled her into a career as a popular philosopher}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her non-fiction works and by giving talks, for example at [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315-316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary doctorate from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, she gave also an annual lecture at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterwards in her famously spirited form to questions from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden hid the affair from Rand. Though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended {{fact|date=August2009}}, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens in 1968 when she discovered Nathaniel Branden's affair with Patrecia Scott and his and Barbara Branden's role in concealing it. As a result, NBI closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344-358}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other &quot;irrational behavior in his private life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=To Whom It May Concern |journal=The Objectivist |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=1–8 |location=New York |year=1968 |month=May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974. Several more of her closest &quot;Collective&quot; friends parted company with her,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=386-389}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the late 1970s her activities within the [[Objectivist movement]] declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=392-395}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''. She had also planned to write another novel, but did not get far in her notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982 at her home in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayn Rand, ‘Fountainhead’ Author, Dies |first=Wolfgang |last=Saxon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/obituaries/07randobit.html?&amp;pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1982 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], [[New York]]. Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her will, Rand named [[Leonard Peikoff]] the heir to her estate. With her endorsement of his 1976 lecture series, she had recognized his work as being the best exposition of her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=xiii-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Rand saw her views as constituting an integrated philosophical system, which she called &quot;Objectivism.&quot;  The essence of Objectivism, according to Rand, is &quot;the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;About the Author&quot; in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170-1171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Rejecting [[faith]] as antithetical to reason, Rand opposed any form of mysticism or supernaturalism, including organized religion, and she embraced [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, Douglas J. &amp; Rasmussen, Douglas B. &quot;Ayn Rand's Realism&quot; in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also argued for [[rational egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the only proper guiding moral principle. The individual &quot;must exist for his own sake,&quot; she wrote in 1962, &quot;neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Voice of Reason]] |first=Ayn |last=Rand |others=Edited by Leonard Peikoff |location=New York |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |isbn=0-453-00634-5 |chapter=Introducing Objectivism |page=3}} This article originally appeared in the ''Los Angeles Times'' on June 17, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, she said that her most important contributions to philosophy were her &quot;theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |year=2005 |title=Ayn Rand Answers, the Best of Her Q&amp;A |isbn=0-451-21665-2 |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand held that the only moral social system is ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]]. Her political views were strongly [[individualism|individualist]] and hence [[anti-statist]] and [[anti-Communist]]. Rand detested many [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[American conservatism|conservative]] politicians of her time, including prominent anti-Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Toffler |first=Alivin |title=Playboy Interview: Ayn Rand |work=Playboy |month=March |year=1964 |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/ayn-rand-playboy-interview/index.html |quote=I'm opposed to any compromiser or me-tooer, and Mr. Nixon is probably the champion in this regard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |first=Maureen |last=Dowd |title=Where 'Atlas Shrugged' Is Still Read - Forthrightly |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/weekinreview/where-atlas-shrugged-is-still-read-forthrightly.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 1982 |accessdate=2009-08-01 |quote=Miss Rand was vehemently anti-Reagan when he challenged Gerald Ford in 1976, and her disciples never saw much sign that she softened toward him over the years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the [[Cato Institute]], considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Isabel Paterson]]) of modern American [[libertarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Jim |title=Rose Wilder Lane, Isabel Paterson, and Ayn Rand: Three Women Who Inspired the Modern Libertarian Movement |url=http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=3345 |journal=The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty |month=May |year=1996 |volume=46 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she rejected libertarianism and the [[libertarian movement]].

==Reception==
Rand's novels, when they were first published, were derided by some critics as long and melodramatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117-119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They became bestsellers due largely to word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reviews Rand received were for her play ''Night of January 16''. Reviews of the Broadway production were mixed, and Rand considered even the positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=122-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rand herself described her first novel, ''We the Living'', as not being widely reviewed, but Michael S. Berliner says &quot;it was the most reviewed of any of her works,&quot; with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Many of these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=Reviews of ''We the Living'' |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's We the Living |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2004 |isbn=0-7391-0698-8 |pages=147-151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1938 novella ''Anthem'' received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for several subsequent re-issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=Reviews of ''Anthem'' |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Anthem |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2005 |isbn=0-7391-1031-4 |pages=55-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=''The Fountainhead'' Reviews |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2006 |isbn=0-7391-1578-2 |pages=77-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a positive review in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that Rand greatly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' reviewer called Rand &quot;a writer of great power&quot; who writes &quot;brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly,&quot; and it stated that she had &quot;written a hymn in praise of the individual... you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lorine |last=Pruette |work=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1943 |title=Battle Against Evil |page=BR7 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FD3D5C167B93C4A8178ED85F478485F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed many of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt; A number of negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot; /&gt; such as one that called it &quot;a whale of a book&quot; and another that said &quot;anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing.&quot; Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style &quot;offensively pedestrian.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt;

Rand's 1957 novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=The ''Atlas Shrugged'' Reviews |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-2780-3 |pages=133-137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[National Review]]'', conservative author [[Whittaker Chambers]] called the book &quot;sophomoric&quot; and &quot;remarkably silly,&quot; and said it &quot;can be called a novel only by devaluing the term&quot;.

During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.&lt;ref name=reception/&gt; When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand &quot;a treacherous undertaking&quot; that could lead to &quot;guilt by association&quot; for taking her seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=With Charity Toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy |last=O'Neill |first=William F. |location=New York |publisher=Littlefield, Adams &amp; Company |year=1977 |origyear=1971 |isbn=0-8226-0179-6 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals prior to her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}.

Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2005|pp=57-58, 63}}.

===Popular interest and influence===
[[Nick Gillespie]], editor in chief of [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'' magazine]], has remarked that &quot;Rand’s is a tortured immortality, one in which she’s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist,&quot; with &quot;jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, running through the [[popular culture]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NPR (audio): [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4475441&amp;sourceCode=RSS &quot;Marking the Ayn Rand Centennial&quot;] by Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of ''Reason Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; A number of popular animated sitcoms have mentioned Rand or her works, including a ''[[Futurama]]'' episode where in the future Rand's works are found in the sewer, a ''[[South Park]]'' episode where ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' is described as a &quot;piece of garbage,&quot; and multiple references in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;illustrated4-5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|2004|pp=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/11/maggie-speaks-the-littles_n_201595.html |title=Maggie Speaks!

Some academic philosophers have attacked Rand for what they assert is a lack of rigor and limited understanding of philosophical subject matter.&lt;ref name=vallicella&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=William Vallicella |first=William |last=Vallicella |url=http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/06/rands-misunderstanding-of-kant.html |work=Maverick Philosopher |title=Rand's Misunderstanding of Kant |date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}{{cite web|date=May 28, 2004 |title=Is Ayn Rand a Good Philosopher? |work=Maverick Philosopher |first=William |last=Vallicella |url=http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/05/is-ayn-rand-good-philosopher.html |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her emphatic defense of capitalism—characterized by a belief in selfishness as a virtue—made Rand a notorious figure who was not accepted by the intellectual mainstream.&lt;ref name=reception/&gt;&lt;ref name=rout&gt;{{cite book |last=Kukathas |first=Chandran |editor=Craig, Edward |title=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0415073103 |chapter=Rand, Ayn (1905–82) |pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adherents and practitioners of [[continental philosophy]] criticize her celebration of self-interest, and as a result have paid little attention to her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophers of Capitalism: Menger, Mises, Rand, and Beyond |last=Younkins |first=Edward W. |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2005 |isbn=0-7391-1076-4 |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic philosophers have generally dismissed ''Atlas Shrugged'' as &quot;sophomoric, preachy, and unoriginal&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boidverts5minutes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Tisdale |first=Sara Dabney |title=A Celebration of Self |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |page=72 |date=August 13 2007 |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070805/13atlas.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have marginalized her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karlin |first=Rick |title=Ayn Rand Followers Push on Objectivists Reflect the Philosophy Found in 'The Fountainhead' |work=The Times Union |location=Albany, NY |page=C1 |date=August 26 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Matthew Sciabarra|Chris Sciabarra]] has called into question the motives of some of Rand's critics on account of what he calls unusual hostility of their criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=9-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sciabarra says, &quot;The left was infuriated by her anti-communist, procapitalist politics, whereas the right was disgusted with her atheism and civil libertarianism.&quot;&lt;ref name=reception&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand scholars such as Sciabarra, [[Allan Gotthelf]], and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] have made attempts to introduce her into formal academia. Sciabarra co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a self-described &quot;nonpartisan&quot; peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/reviews.asp|title=''Journal of Ayn Rand Studies''|accessdate=2006-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society, which is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]] and has been active in sponsoring seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandsociety.org/ |title=Ayn Rand Society |accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has published several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at [[Clemson University|Clemson]] and [[Duke University|Duke]] universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/NEWS/505150346/1014 |title=Ayn Rand at 100: An 'ism' struts its stuff |first=Benjamin |last=Harvey |agency=Columbia News Service |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of English and American [[literature]] have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2005|p=59, 65-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Literary Encyclopedia]]'' entry for Rand written in 2001, John Lewis declared that &quot;Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=litenc&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=John David |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3705 |work=The Literary Encyclopedia |title=Ayn Rand |accessdate=2009-08-02 |date=20 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutes===
In 1985, [[Leonard Peikoff]] established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], which &quot;works to introduce young people to Ayn Rand's novels, to support scholarship and research based on her ideas, and to promote the principles of reason, rational self-interest, individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism to the widest possible audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8345 |title=Charity Navigator Rating - The Ayn Rand Institute |publisher=Charity Navigator |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]]. Its focus is on attracting readers of Ayn Rand's fiction. The associated Objectivist Center division deals with more academic ventures. In 2000, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia. Grants have gone to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthem Foundation Renews Gift for Ayn Rand Research on 50th Anniversary of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; |date=October 1, 2007 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2007/10/01/lib_arts-2/ |accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alain Connes''' (born 1 April 1947) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[College de France]], [[IHÉS]] and [[Vanderbilt University]]. 

==Work==
Alain Connes is one of the leading specialists on [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebras]] in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the 
[[Baum-Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry| noncommutative differential geometry]].

Connes has applied his work in areas of [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2001 and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.  He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].

'''Allan Dwan''' (April 3, 1885 &amp;ndash; December 28, 1981) was a pioneering [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[film|motion picture]] [[film director|director]], producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], his family moved to the United States when he was 11 years old. At the University of Notre Dame, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in [[Chicago]]. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in [[California]] where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part time in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. While still in [[New York]], in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].

==Career==
After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in 1937 he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' the following year.

Over his long and successful career spanning over 50 years, he directed over 400 motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.

'''Algeria''' ({{lang|ar|[[Formal Arabic]]: الجزائر}}, ''al-Jazā’ir''; [[Berber languages|Berber]]: Dzayer; [[French language|French]]: Algérie), officially the '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''', is a [[country]] located in [[North Africa]]. It is the largest country on the Mediterranean sea, the second largest on the African continent&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; and the eleventh-largest country in the world in terms of land area.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta MSN&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered by [[Tunisia]] in the northeast, [[Libya]] in the east, [[Niger]] in the southeast, [[Mali]] and [[Mauritania]] in the southwest, a few kilometers of the Moroccan-controlled [[Western Sahara]] in the southwest, [[Morocco]] in the west and northwest, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the north. Its size is almost 2,400,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an estimated population near to 35,000,000. The capital of Algeria is [[Algiers]]. 

Algeria is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], [[OPEC]] and the [[Arab League]]. It also contributed towards the creation of the [[Maghreb Union]].

==Etymology ==
''Al-jazā’ir'' is itself a truncated form of the city's older name of jazā’ir banī mazghanā, the Arabic for &quot;the islands of (the Berber tribe) Ait Mazghanna&quot;, as used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].

In Classical times northern Algeria was known as [[Numidia]], which included parts of modern day Morocco.

==History ==
{{main|History of Algeria}}

===Ancient history ===
[[Image:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria]]
[[Berber people|Berbers]] have inhabited Algeria since at least [[10,000 BC]]&lt;ref&gt;http://tripatlas.com/Algeria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arab-index.net/CountryInfo.aspx?ID=21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africa-investor.com/article.asp?id=5197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grconsultants.org/Country/Algeria_Expat_Relocation_Mobility_Management_GRC_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/Africaweb/snapshot/Algeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.allexperts.com/e/a/al/algeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alvoyages.com/articles/africa/algeria.html&lt;/ref&gt;; after 1000 BC, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] began establishing settlements along the coast. The Berbers seized the opportunity offered by the [[Punic Wars]] to become independent of Carthage, and Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably Numidia. In 200 BC, however, they were once again taken over, this time by the [[Roman Republic]]. When the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed, Berbers became independent again in many areas, while the [[Vandals]] took control over other parts, where they remained until expelled by the generals of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Justinian I]]. The [[Byzantine Empire]] then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the Arabs in the eighth century.

===Middle Ages ===
The two branches, [[Sanhadja]] and [[Zanata]], were also divided into tribes, with each [[Maghreb]] region made up of several tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;William MacGuckin&quot;&gt;Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale De Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;dq=in+khaldoun#PPR15,M1 |title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |language=French |pages=XV |publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;William MacGuckin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR115&amp;dq=ibn+khaldoun#PPR10,M1 |title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |language=French |pages=X |publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Islam ===
[[Image:Grande mosquée d'Alger.jpg|thumb|left|Great Mosque of Algiers]] 
After the waves of Muslim Arab armies that conquered Algeria from its former Berber rulers and the rule of the Umayyid Arab Dynasty fell, numerous dynasties emerged thereafter. Amongst those dynasties are the [Almohads], [Almoravids], Fatimids of Egypt and Abdelwadids. Having converted the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the [[Rustamid]]s, and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals. When the latter rebelled, the Shia Fatimids sent in the [[Banu Hilal]], a populous Arab tribe, to weaken them. This continued the influx of Arabs into the region since numerous other tribes then migrated with the Banu Hilal such as Banu Sulaym, Banu Muqal, Banu Jashm, Banu Khalt, and others.&lt;ref&gt;History of Ibn Khaldun&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman rule===
{{Unbalanced|date=July 2009}}
In the beginning of the 16th century, after the completion of the [[Reconquista]], the [[Spanish Empire]] attacked the Algerian coastal area and committed many massacres against the civilian population (“about 4000 in Oran and 4100 in Béjaïa). They took control of [[Mers El Kébir]] in 1505, [[Oran]] in 1509, [[Béjaïa]] in 1510, Tenes, Mostaganem, Cherchell and Dellys in 1511, and finally Algiers in 1512.
On 15 January 1510 the King of Algiers, Samis El Phillipe, was forced into submission to the king of Spain; the Spanish Empire turned the Algerian population to subservients. King El Phillipe called for help from the [[corsairs]] Barberous brothers [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] and [[Oruç Reis]] who previously helped [[Andalousia]]n Muslims and Jews to escape from the Spanish oppression in [[1492]].
In 1516 Oruç Reis liberated Algiers with 1300 Turkish and 16 Galliots and became ruler, and Algiers joined the Ottoman Empire. After his death in 1518, his brother [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] succeeded him, the Sultan [[Selim I]] sent him 6000 soldiers and 2000 janissary with which he liberated most of the Algerian territory taken by the Spanish, from Annaba to Mostaganem. Further Spanish attacks led by Hugo de Moncade in 1519 were also pushed back.
In 1541 [[Charles V]] the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] attacked Algiers with a convoy of 65 warships, 451 ships and 23000 battalion including 2000 riders, but it was a total failure, and the Algerian leader Hassan Agha became a national hero. Algiers then became a great military power.

Algeria was made part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by [[Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa]] and his brother Aruj in 1517. They established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Barbary pirate|Ottoman corsairs]]; their [[privateer]]ing peaking in Algiers in the 1600s. Piracy on [[United States|American]] vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1815) with the United States. The pirates forced the people on the ships they captured into [[slavery]]; additionally when the pirates attacked coastal villages in southern and Western Europe the inhabitants were forced into [[Arab slave trade|slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html Barbary Pirates — Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:MoorishAmbassador to Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|The Moorish ambassador of the Barbary States to the Court of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]].]]
The Barbary pirates, also sometimes called [[History of the Turkish Navy#Famous admirals|Ottoman corsairs]] or the Marine Jihad (الجهاد البحري), were Muslim pirates and privateers that operated from North Africa, from the time of the [[Crusades]] until the early 19th century. Based in North African ports such as [[Tunis]] in Tunisia, [[Tripoli]] in Libya, Algiers in Algeria, [[Salé]] and other ports in Morocco, they preyed on [[Christian]] and other non-[[Islam]]ic shipping in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Their stronghold was along the stretch of northern Africa known as the [[Barbary Coast]] (a medieval term for the [[Maghreb]] after its [[Berber people|Berber]] inhabitants), but their predation was said to extend throughout the Mediterranean, south along [[West Africa]]'s Atlantic seaboard, and into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] as far north as [[Iceland]] and the United States. They often made raids, called ''[[Razzia]]s'', on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at [[Islam and slavery#Oriental slave trade|slave markets]] in places such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], Algeria and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_2_urbanities-thomas_jefferson.html |title=Jefferson Versus the Muslim Pirates by Christopher Hitchens, City Journal Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million [[Europe]]ans as slaves. These slaves were captured mainly from seaside villages in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and from farther places like [[France]] or [[England]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]] and even [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]] and North America.

The impact of these [[List of Ottoman sieges and landings|attacks]] was devastating – France, England, and [[Spain]] each lost thousands of ships, and long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants. Pirate raids discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century.
[[Image:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]].]]
The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman ''[[Barbarossa]]'' (&quot;Redbeard&quot;) brothers — [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin (Hızır)]] and his older brother Oruç Reis — who took control of Algiers in the early 16th century and turned it into the centre of Mediterranean piracy and privateering for three centuries, as well as establishing the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s presence in North Africa which lasted four centuries. Other famous Ottoman privateer-admirals included [[Turgut Reis]] (known as [[Dragut]] in the West), [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Kurtoğlu]] (known as [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Curtogoli]] in the West), [[Kemal Reis]], [[Salih Reis]], [[Nemdil Reis]] and [[Murat Reis the Older|Koca Murat Reis]]. Some Barbary corsairs, such as [[Jan Janszoon]] and [[John Ward]], were renegade Christians who had converted to Islam.

In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/09/26/trsic_ed3_.php |title=The mysteries and majesties of the Aeolian Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island [[Gozo]], between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to Libya. In 1554, pirates sacked [[Vieste]] in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centrovacanzeoriente.it/cvoriente/en/dintorni.jsp |title=Vieste}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, Turgut Reis sacked [[Bastia]], [[Corsica]], taking 6000 prisoners. In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of [[Ciutadella]] (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors to [[Istanbul]] as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holidays2menorca.com/history.php |title=History of Menorca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563, Turgut Reis landed on the shores of the province of [[Granada]], Spain, and captured coastal settlements in the area, such as [[Almuñécar]], along with 4,000 prisoners. Barbary pirates often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]], and in response many coastal watchtowers and fortified [[church (building)|churches]] were erected. The threat was so severe that the island of [[Formentera]] became uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm |title=''When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elbacomunico.com/inglese/pirates.htm |title=Watch-towers and fortified towns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1609 to 1616, [[England]] lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Rees Davies, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml British Slaves on the Barbary Coast], [[BBC]], 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Barbary pirates would capture ships and enslave the crew. Latterly American ships were attacked. During this period, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a &quot;license tax&quot; in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Erin Skye, Welcome the Outlaw: Pirates, Maroons, and Caribbean Countercultures Cultural Critique - 59, Winter 2005, pp. 24–62&lt;/ref&gt; One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html |title=Barbary Pirates - Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded Algiers in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |pages=29–30 |isbn=1-59017-218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and particularly violent, and it resulted in the disappearance of about a third of the Algerian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103772b http://gallica.bnf.fr/], La démographie figurée de l'Algérie, op.cit., p.260 et 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1830 and 1847 50,000 French people had emigrated to Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;'France - Republic, Monarchy, and Empire' By Keith Randell&lt;/ref&gt; but the conquest was slow due to intense resistance from such people as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]]. Indeed, the conquest was not technically complete until the early 1900s when the last [[Tuareg]] were conquered by General Guilain P. Denoeux.

Meanwhile, however, the French made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1958. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Spain, [[Italy]], and [[Malta]] moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupied significant parts of Algeria's cities. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=1-59017-218-3 |oclc=|doi=|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-365.html |title=Country Data |publisher=Country-data.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while land development uprooted much of the population.

Starting from the end of the 19th century, people of European descent in Algeria (or natives like [[Spanish people]] in [[Oran]]), as well as the native Algerian [[Jew]]s (typically [[Sephardic]] in origin), became full French citizens. After Algeria's 1962 independence, they were called ''[[pied-noir|Pieds-Noirs]]''; (&quot;Pieds Noirs&quot; meaning &quot;black feet&quot;, referring to the black shoes the Europeans wore on their feet). In contrast, the vast majority of [[Muslim]] Algerians (even veterans of the French army) received neither French citizenship nor the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/292797/Algeria&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===
In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[Algerian War of Independence]] which was a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign. By the end of the war, newly elected [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], understanding that the age of empires was ending, held a [[referendum|plebiscite]], offering Algerians three options. In a famous speech (4 June 1958 in Algiers) de Gaulle proclaimed in front of a vast crowd of Pieds-Noirs &quot;Je vous ai compris&quot; (I have understood you). Most Pieds-noirs then believed that de Gaulle meant that Algeria would remain French. The poll resulted in a landslide vote for complete independence from France. Over one million people, 10% of the population, then fled the country for France and in just a few months in mid-1962. These included most of the 1,025,000 ''Pieds-Noirs'', as well as 81,000 ''[[Harki]]s'' (pro-French Algerians serving in the French Army). In the days preceding the bloody conflict, a group of Algerian Rebels opened fire on a marketplace in Oran killing numerous innocent civilians, mostly women. 

[[Image:Algeri04.jpg|thumb|upright|Cosmopolitan Algiers]]
Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. He was overthrown by his former ally and defence minister, [[Houari Boumédienne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly [[socialism|socialist]] and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and this trend continued throughout Boumédienne's government. However, Boumédienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role. [[Agriculture]] was [[collective farming|collectivised]], and a massive [[industrialization]] drive launched. [[Oil]] extraction facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil which led to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].

In foreign policy, while Algeria shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring Morocco, the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other ever since Algeria's independence. Reasons for this include Morocco's disputed claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963), Algeria's support for the [[Polisario Front]] for its right to [[self-determination]], and Algeria's hosting of [[Sahrawi]] refugees within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]].

Within Algeria, dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the [[Mass media|media]] and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976.

Boumédienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open. The state took on a strongly [[bureaucratic]] character and [[Political corruption|corruption]] was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable [[demography|demographic]] changes to Algeria. Village traditions underwent significant change as [[urbanization]] increased. New industries emerged and agricultural employment was substantially reduced. [[Education]] was extended nationwide, raising the [[literacy]] rate from less than 10% to over 60%. There was a dramatic increase in the [[fertility rate]] to 7–8 children per mother.

Therefore by 1980, there was a very youthful population and a housing crisis. The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: communists, including Berber identity movements; and Islamic 'intégristes'. Both groups protested against [[one-party rule]] but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s. Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Bendjedid to concede the end of one-party rule. Elections were planned to happen in 1991.
In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multi-party elections. The military then intervened and cancelled the second round. It forced then-president Bendjedid to resign and banned all political parties based on religion (including the Islamic Salvation Front). A political conflict ensued, leading Algeria into the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].
More than 160,000 people were killed between 17 January 1992 and June 2002. Most of the deaths were between militants and government troops, but a great number of civilians were also killed. The question of who was responsible for these deaths was controversial at the time amongst academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. Though many of these massacres were carried out by Islamic extremists, the Algerian regime also used the army and foreign mercenaries to conduct attacks on men, women and children and then proceeded to blame the attacks upon various Islamic groups within the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/analysis/africa/an-overview-of-recent-events-in-algeria.html Khilafah - An overview of recent events in Algeria]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Algiers coast.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Algiers]]
Elections resumed in 1995, and after 1998, the war waned. On 27 April 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the [[military]], [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/algehis.htm Arabic German Consulting] www.Arab.de . Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an [[amnesty]] program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas (See [[Islamic insurgency in Algeria (2002–present)]]).

The issue of [[Amazigh languages]] and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]. The government responded with concessions including naming of Tamazight (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

Much of Algeria is now recovering and developing into an [[emerging economy]]. The high prices of oil and [[gas]] are being used by the new government to improve the country's [[infrastructure]] and especially improve [[industry]] and agricultural land. Recently, overseas investment in Algeria has increased.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Algeria}}
[[Image:Algeria Topography.png|thumb|300px|Topographic map of Algeria]]
Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the [[Tell Atlas]] is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape, which ends with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; further south, there is the [[Sahara]] desert. The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers and just west of [[Tamanghasset]]. 

Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.

===Tropic of Cancer in the torrid zone===
In this region even in winter, midday desert temperatures can be very hot. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest temperature recorded in [[Tiguentour]] is 140.9 °F (60.5 °C) and is probably the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Algeria under standard conditions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Rainfall is fairly abundant along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from 400 to {{convert|670|mm|0|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|0|abbr=on}} in some years. Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. [[Prevailing winds]] that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months. Algeria also has [[Erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes between mountains, which in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

==Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Algeria}}
 [[Image:President-abdelaziz-bouteflika.JPG|thumb|150px|Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of Algeria]]
The head of state is the [[President of Algeria]], who is elected for a five-year term. The president, as of a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on November 11, 2008, is not limited to any term length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Africa &amp;#124; Algeria deputies scrap term limit |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of a lower chamber, the ''National People's Assembly (APN)'', with 380 members; and an upper chamber, the ''Council Of Nation'', with 144 members. The APN is elected every five years.

Under the 1976 [[constitution]] (as modified 1979, and amended in 1988, 1989, and 1996) Algeria is a multi-party state. The Ministry of the Interior must approve all parties. To date, Algeria has had more than 40 legal political parties. According to the constitution, no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender or region.&quot;

The military of Algeria consists of the [[People's National Army]] (ANP), the [[Algerian National Navy]] (MRA), and the [[Algerian Air Force]] (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; It is the direct successor of the [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front, which fought French colonial [[military occupation|occupation]] during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62). The commander-in-chief of the military is the president, who is also Minister of National Defense. Total personnel includes 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2008 |author=Hackett, James (ed.)|others=International Institute for Strategic Studies |date=5 February 2008|publisher=Europa |isbn=978-1857434613| url=http://www.zawya.com/printstory.cfm?storyid=v51n20-1TS05&amp;l=134200080519|accessdate=2008-07-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of eighteen months (six training and twelve in civil projects).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096 million),&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB/&gt; or 3.3% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

Algeria is a leading military power in North Africa and has its force oriented toward its western (Morocco) and eastern (Libya) borders. Its primary military supplier has been the former [[Soviet Union]], which has sold various types of sophisticated equipment under military trade agreements, and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Algeria has attempted, in recent years, to diversify its sources of military material. Military forces are supplemented by a 70,000-member [[gendarmerie]] or rural police force under the control of the president and 30,000-member ''Sûreté nationale'' or metropolitan [[police]] force under the Ministry of the Interior. 

In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 [[MiG-29]]SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated $1.5 Billion. They also agreed to return old [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] purchased from the [[Former USSR]]. Russia is also building two [[Kilo class submarine|636-type]] diesel [[submarines]] for Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=070614062644.0d1z4l69&amp;show_article=1| title=Venezuela's Chavez to finalise Russian submarines deal&quot;| publisher=Breitbart| date=[[2007-06-14]]| accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maghreb Union==
Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the [[Western Sahara]] have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Maghreb Union]] and the yearned ''Great Maghreb Sultanate'', which was nominally established in 1989 but carried little practical weight with its coastal neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics, 19 February 1999] www.arabicnews.com .

==Provinces and districts ==
{{main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
[[Image:Algeria wilayas.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of the provinces of Algeria numbered according to the official order]]
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is mostly also the largest city.
According to the Algerian constitution, a province is ''a territorial collectivity enjoying some economic freedom''. The [[People's Provincial Assembly]] is the political entity governing a province, which has a &quot;president&quot;, who is elected by the members of the assembly. They are in turn elected on [[universal suffrage]] every five years. The &quot;[[Wāli#Algerian term|Wali]]&quot; ([[Prefect]] or [[governor]]) directs each province. This person is chosen by the Algerian President to handle the PPA's decisions.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are:&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

==Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Algeria}}
 [[Image:Ministerefinacealger.jpg|thumb|Ministry of Finance of Algeria]]
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of Algeria's economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. The country ranks fourteenth in [[petroleum]] reserves, containing {{convert|11.8|Goilbbl|m3}} of proven oil reserves with estimates suggesting that the actual amount is even more. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven [[natural gas]] reserves (4,502 billion cubic metres)&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html Retrieved 16 March 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;, the eighth largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;eia&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/algeria.html Algeria Country Analysis Brief], EIA, March 2005. Retrieved 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Algeria’s financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[debt]] rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria’s finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in [[oil]] prices and the government’s tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in [[foreign debt]].

The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic [[investment]] outside the energy sector have had little success in reducing high [[unemployment]] and improving living standards, however. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade. In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brtsis.com/ |title=Brtsis, brief on Russian defence, trade, security and energy |publisher=Brtsis.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a visit by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president [[Bouteflika]] agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defense systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter [[Rosoboronexport]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |title=Russia agrees Algeria arms deal, writes off debt |publisher=Reuters |date=11 March 2006 |url=http://za.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=businessNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-11T082958Z_01_BAN130523_RTRIDST_0_OZABS-ECONOMY-RUSSIA-ALGERIA-20060311.XML}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite news |title=La Russie efface la dette algérienne |publisher=Radio France International |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/075/article_42379.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria also decided in 2006 to pay off its full $8bn (£4.3bn) debt to the [[Paris Club]] group of rich creditor nations before schedule. This will reduce the Algerian foreign debt to less than $5bn in the end of 2006. The [[Paris Club]] said the move reflected Algeria's economic recovery in recent years.

==Agriculture ==
Algeria has always been noted for the fertility of its soil. 25% of Algerians are employed in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/AG.html |title=CIA factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time for the United States' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards. In the early years of the twentieth century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed. A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases. Large quantities of dwarf palm are cultivated for the leaves, the fibers of which resemble [[Mane (horse)|horsehair]]. The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and oil) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success. 

More than 7,500,000 acres (30,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s. The [[Tell Atlas]] is the grain-growing land. During the time of French rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[Artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] in districts which only required water to make them fertile. Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals. A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, are exported. Algeria also exports [[fig]]s, [[date (fruit)|dates]], [[esparto|esparto grass]], and [[cork (material)|cork]]. It is the largest [[oat]] market in Africa. 

Algeria is known for Bertolli's [[olive oil]] spread, although the spread has an Italian background.

The population of Algeria is 35,190,000 (jan 2009 est.).&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;
About 70% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic. Almost 30% of Algerians are under 15. Algeria has the fourth lowest [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the [[Greater Middle East]] after [[Cyprus]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

99% of Algerians are classified ethnically as [[Berber people|Berber]] or [[Arab]] by unofficial sources and according to their native language, whether it is a predominantly Arab dialect or a predominantly Berber dialect (because all Algerian dialects are in fact an Arabic-Berber mix, none is pure Arabic or pure Berber), but this doesn't really reflect the real ancestry of Algerians, which is mostly a mixed ancestry made of Berber and different European and Middle Eastern populations that have invaded northwest Africa at different periods of history and mixed with its inhabitants; these groups include Arabs, Turks, Vandals, Phenicians, Romans, Greeks, Egyptians. Thusly, the spoken language bares no indication of the true ancestry of those who speak it.

Europeans account for less than 1% of the population, inhabiting almost exclusively the largest metropolitan areas. However, during the colonial period there was a large (15.2% in 1962) European population, consisting primarily of [[French people]], in addition to [[Spaniards]] in the west of the country, [[Italians]] and [[Maltese people|Maltese]] in the east, and other Europeans in smaller numbers. Known as ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', European colonists were concentrated on the coast and formed a majority of the population of [[Oran]] (60%) and important proportions in other large cities like [[Algiers]] and [[Annaba]]. Almost all of this population left during or immediately after the country's independence from France.

Housing and medicine continue to be pressing problems in Algeria. Failing infrastructure and the continued influx of people from rural to urban areas has overtaxed both systems. According to the [[UNDP]], Algeria has one of the world's highest per housing unit occupancy rates for housing, and government officials have publicly stated that the country has an immediate shortfall of 1.5 million housing units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Women make up 70 percent of Algeria's lawyers and 60 percent of its judges. Women dominate medicine. Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, according to university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slackman |first=Michael |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html |title=A Quiet Revolution in Algeria: Gains by Women - New York Times |doi=Algeria |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=May 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 95,700 [[refugees]] and [[Right of asylum|asylum]]-seekers have sought refuge in Algeria. This includes roughly 90,000 from Morocco and 4,100 from former [[Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. &quot;World Refugee Survey 2008.&quot; Available Online at: http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=2116. pp.34]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 35,000 [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] migrant workers in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L465838.htm Chinese, Algerians fight in Algiers - witnesses]. Reuters. August 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups ===
Ethnic composition of Algeria is mixed Arab and [[Berber people|Berber]]. No official figures can be given, because Algerian law forbids population censuses based on ethnic, religious and linguistic criteria. The Algerian representative for Human Rights, M. Semichi mentioned in 1993 that there were 13-14 million Berbers in Algeria, which would amount to nearly 60% (of a population estimated at that moment as 23 million);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.SR.962.Fr?Opendocument United Nations, CERD, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; he speaks about 7 million people in Kabylie, &quot;8-9 million in the Aurès, in the east of the country&quot; and 1 million in the south. The Aurès region has around 3 million or, if defined very broadly, up to 5 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/udz.html Official Algerian figures by Province]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Berber people, identified as speakers of a [[Berber language]], are divided into several groups, [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] in the mountainous north-central area, [[Chaoui]] in the eastern [[Atlas Mountains]], [[Mozabite]]s in the [[M'zab]] valley, and [[Tuareg]] in the far south, while the Arab Algerians make up the rest of the country.

===Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Algeria}}
[[Image:Kabylia-3lingual sign.jpg|thumb|180px|Trilingual welcome sign in the Isser Municipality (Boumerdès), written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Amazigh language|Amazigh]] ([[Tifinagh]]), and French, typical of Berber cities. Most of Algeria uses only Arabic and French signs.]]

Arabic is spoken as a native language by 60% of the population; of these, over 65% speak [[Algerian Arabic]] and around 11% [[Hassaniya]].&lt;ref name=tlfq&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/AFRIQUE/algerie-1demo.htm http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/], [[Jacques Leclerc (linguiste)|Jacques Leclerc]], L’aménagement linguistique dans le monde. CIRAL (Centre international de recherche en aménagement linguistique)&lt;/ref&gt; Algerian Arabic is spoken as a second language by many Berbers. However, in the media and on official occasions the spoken language is [[Standard Arabic]].

The Berbers (or [[Imazighen]]) speak one of the various dialects of [[Tamazight]] and add up to around 45% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;tlfq&quot;/&gt; Arabic remains Algeria's only [[official language]], although Tamazight has recently been recognized as a [[national language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portant révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on 10 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

French is still the most widely studied [[foreign language]] in the country, and many Algerians speak it fluently, though it is usually not spoken in daily circumstances. Since [[independence]], the government has pursued a policy of linguistic Arabization of [[education]] and bureaucracy, with some success, although many [[university]] courses continue to be taught in French. Recently, schools have started to incorporate French into the curriculum as early as children start to learn Arabic. French is also used in media and commerce.

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Algeria}}
[[Image:NOTRE DAME D'AFRIQUE.ALGER.jpg|thumb|left|[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]] (Our Lady of Africa) - a Roman Catholic church that is the basilica of Algiers]]
[[Islam]] is the predominant religion, followed by more than 95 percent of the country's population. This figure includes all these born in families considered of Muslim descent.
Officially Algerians are Muslims at nearly 100%, however atheists or other kinds of non-believers are not counted in the statistics. 
Nearly all Algerians belong to the Sunni Islam, with the exception of some 200,000 ibadis in the M'zab Valley in the region of [[Ghardaia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/mgcibadi.html Ibadis and Kharijis]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There are also some 400,000 [[Christian]]s in the country, among whom 40,000 [[Catholics]] and 230,000 to 350,000 [[Protestants]], according to the [[Protestant Church of Algeria]]'s leader Mustapha Krim. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topchretien.com/topinfo/view/40011/lalgerie-malmene-ses-chretiens.html Top Chrétien]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodeo.tv/4-33-5995-le-reveil-des-chretiens-d-algerie.html Vodeo TV]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Algeria had an important Jewish community until the 1960s, but there is no active Jewish community today, although a very small number of [[Jew]]s continue to live in Algiers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90207.htm U.S. Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education ==
{{main|Education in Algeria|List of universities in Algeria}}
[[Image:Tasdawit n Bgayet 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Béjaïa University]]
Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 15. In the year 1997, there was an outstanding amount of teachers and students in primary schools. 

In Algeria there are 43 universities, 10 colleges, and 7 institutes for higher learning. The University of Algiers (founded in 1909) has about 267,142 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Algeria-EDUCATION.html |title=Algeria - Education |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Algerian school system is structured into Basic, General Secondary, and Technical Secondary levels:
; Basic: Ecole fondamentale (Fundamental School)&lt;br/&gt;Length of program: 9 years&lt;br/&gt;Age range: 6 to 15&lt;br/&gt;Certificate/diploma awarded: Brevet d'Enseignement Moyen B.E.M. 
; General Secondary: Lycée d'Enseignement général (School of General Teaching), lycées polyvalents (General-Purpose School) &lt;br/&gt;Length of program: 3 years&lt;br/&gt;Age range: 15 to 18&lt;br/&gt;Certificate/diploma awarded: Baccalauréat de l'Enseignement secondaire &lt;br /&gt;(Bachelor's Degree of Secondary School)
; Technical Secondary: Lycées d'Enseignement technique (Technical School)&lt;br/&gt;Length of program: 3 years&lt;br/&gt;Certificate/diploma awarded: Baccalauréat technique (Technical Bachelor's Degree)

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the twentieth century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[Kateb Yacine]], while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 Tahar Djaout] French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. . Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In philosophy and the humanities, [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of [[deconstruction]], was born in [[El Biar]] in Algiers; [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.
Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion. The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir [[Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

In painting, [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khadda.com/ Mohammed Khadda] official site. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'Hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.

[[Image:Karim Ziani 3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karim Ziani]]]]
The most popular sports in the country are [[Association football|football]], athletics and handball. One of the biggest events in Algerian sports was the 1982 national football team's defeat of [[West Germany]] in [[Gijon, Spain]] by a goal from [[Lakhdar Belloumi]]. But because of conflicts, and the poor conditions in Algeria through the 1990s and continuing in some areas of the country today many athletes have left Algeria for countries they could earn more in, usually France. Retired football great [[Zinedine Zidane]] as well as young prodigies [[Karim Benzema]], [[Hatem Ben Arfa]] and [[Samir Nasri]] are all second-generation Algerian immigrants but born in France.
In athletics, Algeria has produced several world champions including [[Noureddine Morceli]], [[Hassiba Boulmerka]], [[Jabir-Said Guerni]], and [[Benida Berrah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel, ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Major characters==
The following are major characters from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Characters are listed as &quot;major&quot; if they meet one of the following criteria:
*they are listed as &quot;major&quot; characters in a widely available study guide, such as [[CliffsNotes]], [[SparkNotes]], or [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale's]] ''Novels for Students'';
*they are listed as &quot;primary heroic&quot; or &quot;archvillain&quot; characters in Gladstein's ''The New Ayn Rand Companion'';
*they are the focus of an essay in a scholarly book about the novel, such as ''Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged'' or ''Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cherryl Brooks===
A dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having mistakenly trusted Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misled, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Upon realizing the nature of the moral code surrounding her, the apparent lack of escape for herself and the heroes she worships, and her unnamed desire to remove support from the machinations she abhors, Cherryl throws herself from a bridge to her death.

===Dagny Taggart===
Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. She holds the title of 'Operating Vice-President in Charge of Operations' of Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny that is actually responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Dagny encounters three romantic relationships, each with a man of ability: [[Francisco d'Anconia]], [[Hank Rearden]], and John Galt. Galt marks the pinnacle of everything Dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth, whom she imagines a man, standing off in the distance, at the end of a great set of railtracks, at the end of all her struggles.

The essential drama of Dagny's character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves, with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it. She believes they simply want to heap burdens upon her, for the sake of others, which she has the ability to carry. Like Hank, she believes they basically want to live, but are too stupid and incompetent to realise how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal. It is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world - John Galt - strapped to a torture machine, about to be killed by the looters (who recognise, too, that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse), that she realises that the moral code of the looters is one of death: that they recognise what is good and necessary for life, but wish to destroy it anyway.

She is a typical [[Randian hero]]ine, similar to [[Dominique Francon]] (''The Fountainhead'') or [[Kira Argounova]] (''We the Living'').

Dagny appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 113, 114, 132, 133, 141, 145, 146, 147, 148, 151, 152, and 161.

===Eddie Willers===
Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with ''Dagny Taggart''. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the promethian creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. He sticks it out with the railway to the bitter end, even when the old world is obviously collapsing and Dagny has shifted her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt. In the end, he stays with the broken-down Comet in the middle of the desert, like a captain going down with his ship. It is unclear whether or not the strikers or anyone else will return to save him. Eddie Willers appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 117, 132, 133, 141, 151, and 152.

===Dr. Floyd Ferris===
One of the Looter crowd who takes credit, along with Wesley Mouch, for Project X though he is considered too stupid to have contributed anything to the project.

===Francisco d'Anconia===
One of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged''. Owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire, the man behind the San Sebastián Mines, and a childhood friend and first love of ''Dagny Taggart''.

Francisco began working on the sly as a teenager in order to learn all he could about business. While still a student at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]], a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler, he began working at a copper foundry, and investing in the stock market. By the time he was twenty he had made enough to purchase the foundry. He began working for d'Anconia Copper as assistant superintendent of a mine in Montana, but was quickly promoted to head of the New York office. In this way he proved that, though unlike other characters he was born to wealth and power, he could have made a successful career all by himself. He took over d'Anconia Copper at age 23, after the death of his father.

When he was 26, Francisco secretly joined the strikers and began to slowly destroy the d'Anconia empire so the looters could not get it. His actions were also specifically designed both to &quot;trap&quot; looters into relying upon, or seizing, his worthless ventures to disrupt their schemes and to try to show them and the rest of the world the inevitable consequences of looting. In the latter he failed, becoming a rather tragic, [[Cassandra]]-esque figure. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover.

He was the childhood friend of Dagny Taggart and [[Eddie Willers]] and later became Dagny's lover. Giving her up—since, knowing her intimately, he knew she would not be ready to join the strikers—was the hardest part for him. He remains deeply in love with her to the end of the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, John Galt and Hank Rearden.  

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia, and he was born in Argentina.

Francisco d'Anconia appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 132, 141, 144, 151, and 152—this last section includes a detailed history of his life.

===Hank Rearden===
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man who started as an ordinary worker, showed talent, founded Rearden Steel and made it the most important steel company of the US (and one of the most important business companies of any kind). Later, he conceived of and invented the Rearden Metal, a form of metal stronger than steel (it stands to steel as steel stands to ordinary iron). 

He is a demanding employer, intolerant of sloppy work, but pays his workers salaries &quot;above any union scale&quot;. He arouses a strong feeling of loyalty among the workers, and was never faced with a strike. 

He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife ''Lillian'', his brother ''Philip'', and his elderly mother (whose name never appears in the book), all of whom he supports. Gwen Ives is his secretary.

The character of Hank Rearden has two important roles to play in the novel. First, he is aware that there is something wrong with the world but is unsure of what it is. Rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with ''Francisco d'Anconia'', who does know the secret, and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in [[John Galt|Galt's Speech]]. 

Second, Rearden is used to illustrate Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]]. ''Lillian Rearden'' cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. ''Dagny Taggart'' clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire. Rearden is torn by a contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, while responding sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates Rand's sexual theory. Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, 147, and 161, and is mentioned in sections 114 and 131.

===Hugh Akston===
Identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]], where he taught ''Francisco d'Anconia'', ''John Galt'', and ''Ragnar Danneskjöld''. He was, along with ''Robert Stadler'', a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. Hugh Akston is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

===James Taggart===
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister ''Dagny Taggart'' to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

In the introduction to the 35th anniversary edition, (1991), [[Leonard Peikoff]] introduced excerpts from Rand's journals concerning the book. Among other things, it is disclosed that as originally conceived James Taggart was religious, regularly going to a priest to confess his sins and ask for absolution. There is no hint of this in the final version as published.

James Taggart appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 143, 144, 152 and 161, and is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 146 and 148.

===John Galt===
{{main|John Galt}}
The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of ''Atlas Shrugged''. He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental who often dines with ''Eddie Willers'' in the employee's cafeteria. Eddie finds him very easy to talk to, and the unnamed work leads him on so that Eddie reveals important information about ''Dagny Taggart'' and Taggart Transcontinental; only Eddie's side of each conversation is given in the novel. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on, and with remarkable consistency, those are the next men to disappear mysteriously. Later in the novel the reader discovers the true identity of this worker is John Galt.

===Lillian Rearden===
The unsupportive wife of ''Hank Rearden''. They have been married eight years as the novel begins. Lillian is a frigid ''Moocher'' who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted.

As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction. Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed. She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value, but fails.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161 she indicates that she abhors ''Francisco d'Anconia'', because she believes he is a sexual adventurer. Lillian Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

===Ragnar Danneskjöld===
One of the original ''Strikers''. He is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar was from [[Norway]], the son of a bishop and the scion of one of Norway's most ancient, noble families. He attended [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and became friends with ''John Galt'' and ''Francisco d'Anconia'', while studying under ''Hugh Akston'' and ''Robert Stadler''. When he became a pirate, he was disowned and excommunicated. There is a price on his head in Norway, [[Portugal]], and [[Turkey]]. 

Ragnar seizes relief ships that are being sent from the [[United States]] to The People's States of [[Europe]]. As the novel progresses, Ragnar begins, for the first time, to become active in American waters, and is even spotted in [[Delaware Bay]]. Reportedly, his ship is better than any available in the fleets of the world's navies. 

People assume that as a pirate he simply takes the seized goods to himself. However, while many other protagonists take pride in making a personal profit from the proceeds of their creativity, Danneskjöld's motivation is to restore to other creative people the money which was unjustly taken away from them - specifically, their [[income tax]] payments. 

For that purpose, Danneskjöld maintains a network of informants who provide him with detailed copies of the tax receipts; among other talents, Danneskjöld is mentioned as being a skilled [[accountant]]. The proceeds from the goods he seizes are deposited in accounts opened in ''Midas Mulligan'''s bank in the names of various industrialists, to the amounts of the income tax taken from them - which are handed to them (in gold) upon their joining the ''Strikers''. 

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet ''Hank Rearden'' in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an &quot;advance payment&quot;, to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation.

As a robber with ideological principles, Danneskjöld might be compared with [[Robin Hood]], but he considers himself as the opposite or complete negative of that Medieval robber, and indeed he considers Robin Hood as an arch-enemy which he had sworn to pursue and destroy. Rather, not Robin Hood the person, who is long dead, but the principle that it is permissible to rob the rich and give to the poor, a principle which in Danneskjöld's (and Rand's) view is highly pernicious. 

In the conversation with Rearden, Danneskjöld claims to limit himself to attacks on government property and never touch private property. This contradicts previous chapters where there is mention of Danneskjöld sinking ships belonging to ''D'anconia Copper'' and destroying ''Orren Boyle'''s plant on the coast of [[Maine]], where Boyle attempted to produce ''Rearden Metal''. However, the first does not truly constitute robbery, since it was done with the consent of and in collusion with the owner, Danneskjöld's old friend ''Francisco D'anconia'', and was aimed at helping Francisco's efforts to destroy his own company. And the second was in reaction to Boyle having violated, with government sanction, Rearden's [[intellectual property]].

Danneskjöld is married to the actress ''Kay Ludlow'' - a relationship kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a former famous [[film star]] who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the ''Strikers'' have strong reservations about his way of &quot;conducting the common struggle&quot;.

Members of Danneskjöld's crew, other than himself, are never named nor appear in the book. In the end of the book, Danneskjöld's crew are mentioned as preparing to form a new community, while his ship would be converted into &quot;a modest ocean [[liner]]&quot;. Danneskjöld himself refreshes his knowledge of [[Aristotle]] and prepares to become a full-time [[philosopher]], and it is hinted that posterity might remember him mainly as ''Hugh Akston'''s disciple rather than as a pirate.    

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing directly Danneskjöld's adventures at sea which were cut out from the final published text.&lt;ref&gt;Reedstrom, Karen. [http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html 1992 Interview with Full Context]. Barbara Branden interview in ''Full Context'', October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden) except for a brief paragraph at the very last chapter.

===Dr. Robert Stadler===
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francsico d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]], [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#John Galt|John Galt]] and [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#Ragnar Danneskj.C3.B6ld|Ragnar Danneskjöld]]. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: ''Project X.'' The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harriman, ''Journals of Ayn Rand'', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wesley Mouch===
At the beginning of the storyline, Mouch is the incompetent lobbyist whom ''Hank Rearden'' reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Eventually he becomes the country's economic dictator. Wesley Mouch appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 and is mentioned in section 161.

==Secondary characters==
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for &quot;major.&quot; Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Andrew Stockton''' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Balph Eubank''' is called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he is incapable of writing anything that people actually want to read. What people ''want'' to read, he says, is irrelevant. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies. Balph Eubank appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Ben Nealy''' is a railroad contractor whom ''Dagny Taggart'' hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement, and this is manifest in his inability to organize the project and to make decisions. He relies on Dagny and ''Ellis Wyatt'' to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around. Ben Nealy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.
*'''Bertram Scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on ''Hank Rearden'' called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Later on he has a radio interview program, in which Dagny Taggart is forced to appear by the threat of revelation of her relationship with Rearden - but she turns the tables by herself revealing the relationship, taking pride in it and denouncing the regime. In the aftermath, Scudder is made the scapegoat and loses his job.   Bertram Scudder appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Betty Pope''' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with ''James Taggart'' that coincides with the overall meaninglessness of her life. She regrets having to wake up every morning because she has to face another empty day. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position. Betty Pope appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 142 and 161.
*'''Bill Brent''' is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Calvin Atwood''' is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins the strike.
*'''Chick Morrison''' holds the position of &quot;Morale Conditioner&quot; in the government.
*'''Claude Slagenhop''' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress (which is supported by ''Philip Rearden''), and one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. He is not bothered by the fact that action unguided by ideas is random and pointless. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Claude Slagenhop appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Cuffy Meigs''' is a thug assigned by Wesley Mouch to keep watch over the workings of Taggart Transcontinental, who later assumes control over the company after Dagny Taggart leaves. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform. Meigs meets his end at the hands of ''Project X.''
*'''Dan Conway''' is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing. He claims that somebody had to be sacrificed, it turned out to be him, and he has no right to complain, bowing to the will of the majority. When pressed he says he does not really believe this is right, but he cannot understand why it is wrong and what the alternative might be. He is trapped by a moral code that makes him a willing victim, and rather than challenge that morality, he simply gives up. Dan Conway appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 145 and 146, and is mentioned in section 148.
*'''Dave Mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental.  He is partially responsible for Kip Chalmers' death.
*'''Dick McNamara''' is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line and who is hired to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line. Before he gets a chance to do so, he mysteriously disappears. Dick McNamara is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 133 and 141.
*'''Ellis Wyatt''' is the head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt Oil]]. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of [[Colorado]] by discovering a new process for reviving what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. He is quick-tempered, more bound to violent outbursts than other characters. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are in fact her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he does not just go quietly away but sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; Without his expertise, the State Science Institute is unable to bring those wells back into production. One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as &quot;Wyatt's Torch&quot;. Later, when Dagny meets him in the hidden valley where his energies are not encountering futile daily obstructions, there is little of that violence to be seen. Ellis Wyatt is mentioned or appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 132, 146, 147, 148, and 152.
*'''Emma Chalmers''' is Kip Chalmers's mother and gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.
*'''Fred Kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose.  At the meeting to decide on whether to enact Directive 10-289 (giving government sweeping powers over industry) Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.
*'''Gerald Starnes and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of ''Jed Starnes''; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which killed worker morale, convinced ''John Galt'' to quit the factory, and drove the company into bankruptcy.  Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers.
*'''Gwen Ives''' is Hank Rearden's secretary.
*'''Horace Mowen''' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. He is unable to grapple with abstract issues, and is frightened of anything controversial. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be ridden and cajoled before he is willing to accept the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source. Mowen appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.
*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.
*'''Judge Narragansett''' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. He is a staunch supporter of the [[inalienable rights]] theory, and in the final pages he is seen rewriting the [[United States Constitution]] to state those rights more explicitly.
*'''Kay Ludlow''' is a beautiful actress and the wife of to Ragnar Danneskjöld.
*'''Ken Danagger''' owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden metal.
*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that was carrying him encountered a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine-at that point, one of the last of its kind left anywhere in the world. After a chilling show of bureaucracy, a coal-burning steam engine was attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. This action, for whom no one could later be blamed, resulted in suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.
*'''Lawrence Hammond''' runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, and joins the strike.
*'''Midas Mulligan''' is a wealthy banker, whose financial backing had a major share in launching the career of Hank Rearden and other prominent industrialists. He mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down, he liquidated his entire business, made sure that all the account holders received every penny due them, and joined Galt's strike. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him &quot;[[Midas]]&quot; in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment. Mulligan is responsible for the creation and distribution of the money that is exclusively used in Galt's Gulch, and is the original owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located hence its official name: Mulligan's Valley.
*'''Mort Liddy''' is a [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies that no one listens to. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends and a member of the cultural elite. Mort Liddy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Nathaniel Taggart''' is meant to symbolize the so-called Robber Barons of America's industrial age. Nat Taggart was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. Many stories are told about him: that he once killed a state legislator who tried to use his office to destroy the railroad; that he once put his wife up as collateral for a loan. He never earned money by force or fraud, and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time (mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 132 and 152).
*'''Orren Boyle''' is he head of Associated Steel and a friend of ''James Taggart''. He is an investor in the San Sebastián Mines. Orren Boyle appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 144, and 152.
*'''Owen Kellogg''' is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in [[New York]]. He catches ''Dagny Taggart's'' eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. He admits that he loves his work, but that is not enough to keep him. He will not say why he is leaving or what he will do. Later, he is noticed working as transient labor by the unsuccessful/unmotivated businessman ''Mr. Mowen''. Owen Kellog eventually reaches, and settles in, Atlantis. Owen Kellogg appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 114.
*'''Paul Larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121 Larkin visits [[Philadelphia]] to warn ''Hank Rearden'' of possible trouble from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 he meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them. Paul Larkin appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, and 2A1.
*'''Philip Rearden''' is he younger brother of ''Hank Rearden''. He lives in his brother's home in [[Philadelphia]] and is completely dependent on him. He believes that the source of his sustenance is evil and would love to see him destroyed. He has never had a career and spends his time working for various social groups. He becomes resentful of his brother's charity. He then requests that he be granted a job from his brother because he should not have to be burdened by the feeling of inadequacy of not earning his own livelihood. When confronted by his brother on how this job should be a mutually beneficial arrangement, Philip shrugs the argument off as irrelevant and that he should be entitled to the job solely based on his need for money and the fact of familial ties. Philip Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.
*'''Quentin Daniels''' is an enterprising engineer hired by ''Dagny Taggart'' to reconstruct ''John Galt's'' motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny makes him promise to not disappear as she sets out to meet Quentin in hopes of convincing him to resume his work.  John Galt narrowly gets to him first.  Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]].&quot; When Dagny arrives in Galt's Gulch, Quentin apologizes profusely. In his excitement over Galt's explanation of the motor and invitation to join the Strikers, he had forgotten his promise to remain. He is given a job as janitor at the power plant and hopes to learn enough to become an electrician.
*'''Rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with her son ''Hank Rearden'' at his home in [[Philadelphia]]. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She insults him by saying he was always selfish, even as a child. She dotes on her weak son ''Philip Rearden''. Rearden's mother appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.
*'''Richard Halley''' is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141 we learn that Richard Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24 his opera ''Phaethon'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. (It was based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] in which [[Phaethon]] steals his father's chariot, and dies in an audacious attempt to drive the sun across the sky. Halley changed the story, though, into one of triumph, in which Phaethon succeeds.) For years Halley wrote in obscurity. After nineteen years, ''Phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. It appears his critics felt he had paid his dues long enough that he was at last worthy of their approval. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. Richard Halley is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 114, 133, and 141, and appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.
*'''Roger Marsh''' is the owner of a factory and joins the strike.
*'''Ray McKim''' is a young fireman who works the first run of the John Galt Line. 
*'''Dr. Simon Pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and considered the leading philosopher of the age. He is a crude reductionist who believes man is nothing but a collection of chemicals; he believes there are no standards, that definitions are fluid, reason is a superstition, that it is futile to seek meaning in life, and that the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood. He explains all this in his book ''The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe'', and at cocktail parties. Dr. Pritchett appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
*'''Dr. Thomas Hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.
*'''Mr. Thompson''' is the &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]]&quot; for the [[United States]]. One of the Looters, he's not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modelled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]].
*'''Tom Colby''' is the head of the steelworkers union chapter of Rearden Steel. The workforce of Rearden Steel is the highest paid, and therefore the best, in the country, so Colby rarely challenges his boss. When he retires from Rearden Steel, he assures Hank Rearden that he is on his side.
*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden’s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters’ code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers.  He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.
*'''Mrs. William Hastings''' widow of William Hastings. Graying hair, has a poised distinguished look of grooming. Gives Dagny a lead where she discovers Hugh Akston working as a cook in a roadside diner.

==Planned characters excluded from the final version==
In the introduction to the 35th anniversary edition, (1991), [[Leonard Peikoff]] introduced excerpts from Rand's journals concerning the book, which she originally intended to call &quot;The Strike&quot;. Among many other things, the journals reveal some characters which were originally planned to appear in the book and were deleted from the final version.

===Father Amadeus===
Peikoff tells that &quot;'''Father Amadeus''' was Taggart's priest, to whom he confessed his sins. The priest was supposed to be a positive character honestly devoted to the good but practicing consistently the morality of mercy. Miss Rand dropped him, she told me, when she found that it was impossible to make such a character convincing.&quot; 

The quotation from Rand's journals included a passage describing what John Galt represented to each main characters. That included the following: &quot;For Father Amadeus [Galt represents] the source of the conflict. The uneasy realisation that Galt is the end of his endeavors, the man of virtue, the perfect man - and that his means do not fit this end (and that he is destroying this, his ideal, for the sake of those who are evil).&quot;

===Stacy Rearden===
Peikoff also mentions that as originally conceived the book was going to have a character named '''Stacy Rearden''', a sister of '''Hank Rearden'''. Not much is told of what her role was supposed to be and why she was eventually dropped. Apparently, she was going to be another parasite like Rearden's brother, mother and wife; presumably, Rand came to the conclusion that three such characters around Rearden sufficiently fulfilled her literary and philosophical purposes.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology''' ({{pron-en|ænθrɵˈpɒlədʒi}}, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}}, ''anthrōpos'', &quot;human&quot;, and -λογία, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', &quot;discourse&quot;, first use in English: 1593)&lt;ref&gt;Nunes, Rossano Carvalho (2007) &quot;Anthopology&quot; [http://www.gpveritas.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=63 Veritas Group of Research in History and Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of [[humans|human beings]], everywhere and throughout time. 

Anthropology has its intellectual origins in both the [[natural sciences]], and the [[humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1994) ''Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People.'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' 35: 1-7. p.227&lt;/ref&gt;  Its basic questions concern, &quot;What defines Homo sapiens?&quot;  &quot;Who are the ancestors of modern Homo sapiens?&quot; &quot;What are our physical traits?&quot;  &quot;How do we behave?&quot;  &quot;Why are there variations and differences among different groups of humans?&quot;  &quot;How has the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens influenced its social organization and culture?&quot; and so forth. 

While specific modern anthropologists have a tendency to specialize in technical subfields, their data and ideas are routinely synthesized into larger works about the scope and progress of our species.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared.  ''Guns, Germs and Steel''. W.W. Norton. 2005; Johanson, Donald, Blake Edgar and David Brill.  ''From Lucy to Language''. Weidenfeld Nicolson 2001; Harris, Marvin.  ''Culture, People, Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology. Allyn &amp; Bacon. 1997''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term &quot;anthropology&quot; refers in common parlance most often to [[Cultural Anthropology]], the study of the culture, beliefs, and practices of living people. In American universities, however, the department of Anthropology often includes three or four subfields, including cultural anthropology, [[archaeology]], [[biological anthropology]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. However, in universities in the [[United Kingdom]], and much of [[Europe]], these fields are frequently housed in separate departments.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A brief overview of the discipline==
One traditional approach to simplifying such a vast enterprise has been to divide anthropology into four fields, each with its own further branches: [[Biological anthropology|biological or physical anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[archaeology]] and [[anthropological linguistics]]. 

Briefly put, biological or physical anthropology includes the study of [[Evolution|human evolution]], human [[evolutionary biology]], [[population genetics]], our nearest biological relatives, [[Taxonomy|classification]] of ancient hominids, [[paleontology]] of humans, distribution human [[alleles]], blood types and the [[Human Genome Project|human genome project]]. [[Primatology]] studies our nearest non-human relatives (human beings are primates), and some primatologists use field observation methods, written up in a manner quite similar to ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Power, Margaret (1991). The Egalitarians - Human and Chimpanzee An Anthropological: View of Social Organization. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521400163&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biological anthropology is used by other fields to shed light on how a particular folk got to where they are, how frequently they've encountered and married outsiders, whether a particular group is protein-deprived, and to understand the brain processes involved in the production of language. Other related fields or subfields include [[paleoanthropology]], [[anthropometrics]], nutritional anthropology, and [[forensic anthropology]].

Cultural anthropology is often based on [[ethnography]], a kind of writing used throughout anthropology to present data on a particular people or folk (from the Greek, ''ethnos''/Έθνος), often based on [[participant observation]] research. [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. Cultural anthropology is also called socio-cultural anthropology or social anthropology (especially in Great Britain). In some European countries, cultural anthropology is known as [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783).&lt;ref&gt;Han F. Vermeulen, &quot;The German Invention of ''Völkerkunde:'' Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1740-1798.&quot; In: Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore, eds. ''The German Invention of Race.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of cultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Cultural anthropology also covers: economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language, which is also the object of study in linguistics. Note the way in which some of these topics overlap with topics in the other subfields. 

Archaeology is the study of human material culture, including both [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (older pieces of human culture) carefully gathered ''in situ'', museum pieces and modern garbage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists work closely with biological anthropologists, art historians, physics laboratories (for dating), and museums. They are charged with preserving the results of their excavations and are often found in museums. Typically, archaeologists are associated with &quot;digs,&quot; or excavation of layers of ancient sites. 

Archaeologists subdivide time into cultural periods based on long-lasting artifacts: for example the [[Paleolithic]], the [[Neolithic]], the [[Bronze Age]], which are further subdivided according to artifact traditions and culture region, such as the [[Oldowan]] or the [[Gravettian]]. In this way, archaeologists provide a vast reference of the places human beings have traveled over the past 200,000 years, their ways of making a living, and their [[demographics]]. Archaeologists also investigate nutrition, symbolization, art, systems of writing, and other physical remnants of human cultural activity.

Linguistics is the study of language.  [[Linguistic anthropology]] (also called [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[anthropological linguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  

This field is divided into its own subfields: [[descriptive linguistics]] the construction of grammars and lexicons for unstudied languages; [[historical linguistics]], including the reconstruction of past languages, from which our current languages have descended; [[ethnolinguistics]], the study of the relationship between language and culture, and [[sociolinguistics]], the study of the social functions of language. Anthropological linguistics is also concerned with the evolution of the parts of the brain that deal with language.&lt;ref&gt;http://anthropology.net/2007/08/15/new-york-times-reviews-kenneallys-the-first-word/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of Anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy.  ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. 2003. p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Stocking, “Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology.” In George Stocking, The Ethnographer’s Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992):342-361.[&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray. ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.''  Columbia University Press. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;  

Anthropology has also been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[global studies]], and various [[ethnic studies]].

==Basic trends in anthropology==

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called &quot;primitive&quot; in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of &quot;inferior.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lowie, Robert.  ''Primitive Religion''. Routledge and Sons. 1924; Tylor,Edward. 1920 [1871]. Primitive Culture. New York: J.P. Putnam’s Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, most anthropologists use terms such as &quot;less complex&quot; societies or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as &quot;hunter-gatherer&quot; or &quot;forager&quot; or &quot;simple farmer&quot; to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology. 

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular folk or people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms.  ''Culture Counts.'' Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato.  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo.  ''The Anthropology of Globalization. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jurmain, Lynn Kilgore, Wenda Trevathan, and Russell L. Ciochon.  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. 2007, chapters I, III and IV.''; Womack, Mari.  ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. 2001, pp. 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald.  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill. 1991; Roughley, Neil.  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot;  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs. Due to the interest in variation, anthropologists are drawn to the study of human extremes, aberrations and other unusual circumstances, such as [[headhunting]], [[whirling dervishes]], whether there were real [[Homo floresienses|Hobbit people]], [[snake handling]], and [[Glossolalia|glossolalia (speaking in tongues)]], just to list a few.  

At the same time, anthropologists urge, as part of their quest for scientific objectivity, [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the subfields of anthropology. This is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture's values or viewpoints, but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude.  ''The Savage Mind''. 1962; Womack, Mari.  ''Being Human.'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] including especially circumcision and subincision, and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery or human sacrifice, therefore, attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.  ''Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[acculturation]], [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of man's inhumanity to man. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the subfields (and subfields of subfields).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm; http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/282/5389/654?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;titleabstract=DNA+challenges+race&amp;searchid=QID_NOT_SET&amp;FIRSTINDEX=; Shanklin, Eugenia. 1994. Anthropology &amp; Race; Faye V. Harrison. 1995. &quot;The Persistent Power of 'Race' in the Cultural and Political Economy of Racism.&quot; Annual Review of Anthropology. 24:47-74. Allan Goodman. 1995. &quot;The Problematics of &quot;Race&quot; in Contemporary Biological Anthropology.&quot; In Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science.; Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, 1945-.  &quot;Melanin, Afrocentricity...,&quot; 36(1993):33-58.; see Stanford's recent collection of overarching bibliographies on race and racism here: http://library.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/misc/race.html  &lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition to dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[Culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]], which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaanet.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is made up of Anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various subfields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Kate Wong. ''Lucy's Legacy''. Kindle Books. 2007; Netti, Bruno. ''The study of ethnomusicology.''  University of Illinois Press. 2005. Chapter One &lt;/ref&gt;

==History of anthropology==
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The first use of the term &quot;anthropology&quot; in English to refer to a natural science of humankind was apparently in 1593, the first of the &quot;logies&quot; to be coined.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanowicz, Charles. In the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, reprinted online: http://www.csuchico.edu/~curbanowicz/Pub_Papers/4field.html&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Immanuel Kant]] 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, his ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel.  &quot;Introduction&quot; to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted: http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, however, as he never left his region of Germany nor did he study any cultures besides his own.&lt;ref&gt;acobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., ISBN 0521790387.&lt;/ref&gt;  He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772. Anthropology is thus primarily an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] endeavor. 

Historians of anthropology, like Marvin Harris&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.  ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory.''  Alta Mira Press. 2000 (revised from 1968); Harris, Marvin.  ''Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times. Altamira. 1998''&lt;/ref&gt; indicate two major frameworks within which empirical anthropology has arisen: interest in comparisons of people over space and interest in longterm human processes or humans as viewed through time. Harris dates both to [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]], specifically [[Herodotus]], often called the &quot;father of history&quot; and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]], who wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. Herodotus first formulated some of the persisting problems of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1968, op cit. pp. 8-52; Leaf 1970, op cit. pp. 1-13; Erickson and Murph, 2003, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered &quot;different&quot; from themselves in terms of geography.  [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he encountered as he  journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name &quot;the father of modern anthropology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the 11th century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity]] and [[neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;Akbar S. Ahmed (1984). &quot;Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist&quot;, ''RAIN'' '''60''', p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Walbridge (1998). &quot;Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam&quot;, ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''59''' (3), p. 389-403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). &quot;Islamic Anthropology&quot; and the &quot;Anthropology of Islam&quot;, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Biruni's tradition of comparative cross-cultural study continued in the [[Muslim world]] through to [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s work in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Ahmed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorq.org/Articles/article.aspx?d=2002&amp;x=arabviews West Asian views on black Africans during the medieval era]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars{{Fact|date=April 2009}} consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a period when Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the 15th century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part. 

Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the &quot;culture concept,&quot; which is central to the discipline. 
[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Table of natural history, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the &quot;human primitives&quot; overseen by colonial administrations. 

There was a tendency in late 18th century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved in accordance with certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.   

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most 19th-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past. 

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the 19th century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism has been that many social science scholars (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focus disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuses disproportionately on the &quot;Other&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this has changed over the last part of the 20th century as anthropologists increasingly also study Western subjects, particularly variation across class, region, or ethnicity within Western societies, and other social scientists increasingly take a global view of their fields.

=== 20th Century ===
In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural and biological ''[[sciences]]'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''[[humanities]]'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. 

The ''[[social sciences]]'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences. In particular, social sciences often develop statistical descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. (2003) &quot;Anthropology, sociology, and other dubious disciplines.&quot; ''Current Anthropology'' 44:453-466.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology as it emerged among the colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) &quot;Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason,&quot; in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32-58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in the nationalist/nation-building enterprise. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of the nation through museums and other forms of public education.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large Asian region of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas; on the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist discourses of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, anthropology in the USSR and later the Soviet Bloc countries were highly shaped by the need to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology by nation==
===Anthropology in Britain===
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|E. B. Tylor, 19th-century British anthropologist.]]
[[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] ( 2 October 1832 – 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] ( 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Though Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not fieldwork, mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists. 

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of &quot;uniformity of mankind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) &quot;Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention,&quot; ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: &quot;independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race [sic] to another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as &quot;that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists. 

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious feelings in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that &quot;religion&quot; has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. 

Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, were particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative. 

Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a multidisciplinary expedition to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by Alfred Court Haddon and including a physician-anthropologist, [[W. H. R. Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description. 

A decade and a half later, Polish-born anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884-1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt; Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting &quot;the native's point of view&quot; through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to meet individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributors as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970]'' review: [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-0496(199702)24%3A1%3C211%3ATEMTRO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism|structural-functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for &quot;Social Anthropology&quot; by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.'' 

[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities. 

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it &quot;contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Heyck [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762%28199712%29102%3A5%3C1486%3AATBSA1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7] The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (Dec., 1997), pp. 1486-1488 doi:10.2307/2171126&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

===Anthropology in the United States===
====19th Century to 1940s====
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies.

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Boas, one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the &quot;Father of American Anthropology&quot;]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].  

[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818-1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York]], became an advocate for an ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;This would be influential on the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], who dedicated [[Das Kapital]] to Morgan.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boasian anthropology====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little &quot;civilization&quot; they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible. 

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called &quot;Four Field Approach&quot; has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (i.e., archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|Ruth Benedict in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up. 

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Anthropology in Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 1600s, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Domain of Canada.

True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910. Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===Anthropology in France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|Émile Durkheim]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology. 

Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872-1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's [[Année Sociologique]] group; and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states. 

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]]'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) &quot;A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self.,&quot; in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as “Une categorie de l’Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de ‘Moi’,” for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]] which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

Above all, however, it was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. In addition to the enormous influence his [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]] who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities. 

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that &quot;primitive societies&quot; actively oppose the institution of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Therefore, these stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but took the active choice of conjuring the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups (&quot;international relations&quot;) but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.

The most important French social theorist since Foucault and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, however, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the Kabyles of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===Other countries===
Anthropology in [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]] is much influenced by British anthropology.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} In [[Greece]], there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of &quot;a science of the interior&quot;, although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science &quot;of the outside&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, « L'anthropologie en Grèce », Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990) , [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005.

==Anthropology after World War II: Increasing dialogue in Anglophone anthropology==
Before [[World War II|WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some anthropologists, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]], focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche—an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]]. 

[[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[George Dalton]] challenged standard neoclassical [[economics]] to take account of cultural and social factors, and also employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including [[Psychological anthropology#Cognitive Anthropology|cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis. Authors such as [[David Schneider (anthropologist)|David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]];&lt;ref&gt;Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] became a more and more popular theoretical approach in the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Stephen ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=4 Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism]'' The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''[[Europe and the People Without History]]'', have been central to the discipline. In the 80s books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and [[hegemony]] into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again), who drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. Also influential in these issues were [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], the critical theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Derrida]] and [[Lacan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294(199809)2%3A100%3A3%3C716%3ATMOAAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100:&quot; 716-731&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by Feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theorizing and methods became ''de rigueur'' as part of the 'post-modern moment' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author's methodology, cultural, gender and racial positioning, and their influence on his or her ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-50&lt;/ref&gt; Currently anthropologists pay attention to a wide variety of issues pertaining to the contemporary world, including [[globalization]], [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]], [[rights of indigenous peoples|indigenous rights]], [[virtual communities]], and the anthropology of [[industrial society|industrialized societies]].

==Controversies about the history of anthropology==
Anthropologists, like other researchers (esp. historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some commentators have contended:

*That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.   (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion''. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*That anthropologists typically have more power than the people they study and hence their knowledge-making is a form of theft in which the anthropologist gains something for him or herself at the expense of informants. 
*That ethnographic work was often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; ([[Johannes Fabian]], ''Time and Its Other''). 

=== Anthropology and the military ===
Anthropologists’ involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in [[World War I]], and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists. 

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the &quot;Axis&quot; (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces but others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies. 

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn [[Project Camelot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot.&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement and a great many resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA). 

In the decades since the Vietnam war the tone of cultural and social anthropology, at least, has been increasingly politicized, with the dominant liberal tone of earlier generations replaced with one more radical, a mix of, and varying degrees of, Marxist, feminist, anarchist, post-colonial, post-modern, Saidian, Foucauldian, identity-based, and more.&lt;ref&gt;D'Andrade, Roy (1995) &quot;Moral Models in Anthropology.&quot; ''Current Anthropology'' 36: 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA ) has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;

However, anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are once again being used in warfare as part of the [http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan]. The [[Christian Science Monitor]] reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], under the [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] of [http://www.army.mil/professionalwriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html ''Human Terrain Team'' (HTT)].

==Major discussions about anthropology==
===Focus on other cultures===&lt;!-- title wikilinked from  [[Urban anthropology]] --&gt;
Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-[[Western world|Western]] societies). For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz]] (1980) &quot;Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology&quot;, ISBN 0231083769, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot; /&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like [[History]] and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]'' Cambridge University Press ISBN 0521870690&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of existing contemporary society has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;*Marc Abélès, ''[http://www.jstor.org/view/08867356/ap020057/02a00050/3?frame=noframe How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field] ''[[Cultural Anthropology]]'' 1999 p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like [[Isac Chiva]] and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies). The same approach of focusing on &quot;modern world&quot; topics by ''Terrain'', was also present in the British [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]] of the 1950s.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:
*[[Agriculture]] is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* [[traditional agricultural systems]], sometime termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which in may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil and the USA.

==Agricultural science: a local science==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.

==History of agricultural science==
{{main|History of agricultural science}}

Agricultural science began with [[Mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as Avian Flu, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

'''Alchemy''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:''al-kimia'') ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:אלכימיה ''al-himia'')  is both a [[philosophy]] and a practice with an aim of achieving ultimate [[wisdom]] as well as [[immortality]], involving the improvement of the alchemist as well as the making of several substances described as possessing unusual properties. The practical aspect of alchemy generated the basics of modern [[inorganic chemistry]], namely concerning procedures, equipment and the identification and use of many current substances.

The fundamental ideas of alchemy are said to have arisen in the ancient [[Persian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Holmyard, ''Alchemical Equipment'' in &quot;A History of Technologyy ed. E. Singer et al.&quot; vol. II (Oxford, 1957), p. 731.&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemy has been practiced in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Persia]] (today's [[Iran]]), [[India]], [[Chinese alchemy|China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and in [[Classical Antiquity|Classical]] [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim civilizations]], and then in [[Europe]] up to the 20th century—in a complex [[Social network|network]] of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Chemistry (etymology)}}
Alchemy, generally, derives from the [[Old French]] ''alkemie;'' from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-kimia:'' &quot;the art of transformation.&quot;  Some scholars{{Who|date=April 2009}} believe the Arabs borrowed the word ''chimia'' (&quot;χημεία&quot;) from [[Greek language|Greek]] for transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of English Etymology | author = Walter W. Skeat | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=M7kCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=arabs+kimia+greeks&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=Z0dYSdmvD5rqkQSF0dz4Bw#PPA287,M1 | publisher = Oxford: Clarendon Press | year = 1892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Mahdihassan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=3064584&amp;dopt=Abstract Mahdihassan S. &quot;Alchemy, Chinese versus Greek, an etymological approach: a rejoinder&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; argue that its origins are [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

During the seventeenth century the change of name from Alchemy to chemistry took place, with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], sometimes known as &quot;The father of Chemistry&quot; {{Fact|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. How about [[Antoine Lavoisier]]?|date=April 2009}}, who in his book &quot;The Skeptical Chymist&quot; attacked [[Paracelsus]] and the old [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Classical element|concepts of the elements]] and laid down the foundations of modern chemistry.

==Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline==
[[Image:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Renel the Alchemist&quot;, by Sir William Douglas, 1853]]

Alchemy became known as the ''spagyric art'' after Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'' in the 16th century, the word probably being coined by Paracelsus. Compare this with one of the dictums of Alchemy in Latin: &lt;small&gt;[[SOLVE ET COAGULA]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;— ''Separate, and Join Together'' (or ''dissolve and coagulate'').

The best-known goals of the [[List of alchemists|alchemist]]s were the [[wiktionary:transmutation|transmutation]] of common metals into [[gold]] (called [[chrysopoeia]]) or [[silver]] (less well known is plant alchemy, or &quot;[[spagyric]]&quot;); the creation of a &quot;[[panacea (medicine)|panacea]]&quot;, or the [[elixir of life]], a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely; and the discovery of a [[Alkahest|universal solvent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy Alchemy at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Although these were not the only uses for the discipline, they were the ones most documented and well known. Certain Hermetic schools argue that the transmutation of lead into gold is analogical for the transmutation of the physical body (Saturn or lead) into Solar energy (gold) with the goal of attaining immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golden-dawn.com/eu/displaycontent.aspx?pageid=102 The True Nature of Hermetic Alchemy] &lt;/ref&gt; This is described as Internal Alchemy. Starting with the [[Middle Ages]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic]] and European alchemists invested much effort in the search for the &quot;[[philosopher's stone]]&quot;, a legendary substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals.  Alchemists were alternately persecuted or supported through the centuries.   For example in 1317 Pope John 22nd issued a Bull against alchemical counterfeiting, and the Cistercians banned the practice amongst their members.  In 1403 Henry 4th of England banned the practice of Alchemy.  In the late 14th century Piers the Ploughman and [[Chaucer]] both painted unflattering pictures of Alchemists as thieves and liars.  By contrast, [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, sponsored various alchemists in their work at his court in Prague.  

Some people{{Who|date=April 2009}} suppose that Alchemists made mundane contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day—ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of gunpowder, ink, dyes, paints, cosmetics, [[Tanning|leather tanning]], ceramics, glass manufacture, preparation of extracts, liquors, and so on (it seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists).  In reality, although Alchemists contributed [[distillation]] to Western Europe, they did little for any known industry.  Goldsmiths knew long before Alchemists appeared how to tell what was good gold or fake, and industrial technology grew by the work of the artisans themselves, rather than any Alchemical helpers.  

Several early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], are recorded as viewing alchemy as a spiritual discipline, and in the Middle Ages, metaphysical aspects increasingly came to be viewed as the true foundation of the art. Organic and inorganic chemical substances, physical states, and molecular material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states and ultimately, transformations. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]], which being at odds with the Medieval Christian Church was a necessity that could have otherwise led them to the &quot;stake and rack&quot; of the Inquisition under charges of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Blavatsky |first= H.P. |title= [[The Secret Doctrine]] |publisher= Theosophical Publishing Company |year= 1888 |isbn= 978-1557000026 |volume=ii |page=238 |url=http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/SDVolume2.htm |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning. 

In his ''Alchemical Catechism'', [[Paracelsus]] clearly denotes that his usage of the metals was a symbol:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/tschoudy.htm |title=Alchemical Catechism |accessdate=2007-04-18 |author=Paracelsus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Psychology ===

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used  by [[psychology|psychologists]] and philosophers. [[Carl Jung]] reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Hinkle, B. M. (1912). Psychology of the Unconscious : a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido, a contribution to the history of the evolution of thought. London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner. (revised in 1952 as Symbols of Transformation, Collected Works Vol.5 ISBN 0-691-01815-4)&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical philosophy, symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in [[post-modernism|post-modern]] contexts.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

Jung saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of [[individuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which [[Gnosticism]] survived its various purges into the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Jaffe A. (1962). Memories, Dreams, Reflections. London: Collins. This is Jung's autobiography, recorded and edited by Aniela Jaffe, ISBN 0-679-72395-1&lt;/ref&gt;, a concept also followed by others such as [[Stephan A. Hoeller]]. In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a [[Yoga]] of the East, and more adequate to the Western mind than Eastern religions and philosophies. The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist. Conversely, spontaneous changes on the mind of Western people undergoing any important stage in [[individuation]] seems to produce, on occasion, imagery known to Alchemy and relevant to the person's situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. - Psychology and Alchemy; Symbols of Transformation&lt;/ref&gt; 

His interpretation of [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical texts]] in terms of his [[analytical psychology]] also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]).&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnum opus ===
{{main|Magnum opus}}
''The Great Work''; mystic interpretation of its four stages:&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.scribd.com/doc/11441835/The-Four-Stages-of-Alchemical-Work The-Four-Stages-of-Alchemical-Work]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[nigredo]](-putrefactio)'', blackening(-putrefaction): corruption, dissolution, [[individuation]], ''see also [[Suns_in_alchemy#Opus_Magnum|Suns in alchemy - Sol Niger]] 
*''[[Albedo_(alchemy)|albedo]]'', whitening: purification, burnout of impurity; the moon, female
*''[[citrinitas]]'', yellowing: spiritualisation, enlightenment; the sun, male;
*''[[rubedo]]'', reddening: unification of man with god, unification of the limited with the unlimited.

After the 15th century, many writers tended to compress ''[[citrinitas]]'' into ''[[rubedo]]'' and consider only three stages.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.e-scoala.ro/germana/mihai_stroe26.html Meyrink und das theomorphische Menschenbild]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, it is in citrinitas that the Chemical Wedding takes place, generating the Philosophical Mercury without which the Philosopher's Stone, triumph of the Work, could never be accomplished.

Within the Magnum Opus, was the creation of the [[Sanctum Moleculae]], that is the 'Sacred Masses' that were derived from the [[Sacrum Particulae]], that is the 'Sacred Particles', needed to complete the process of achieving the Magnum Opus.

== Alchemy as a subject of historical research ==

The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure hermetic language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[kabbala|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements, [[cryptography]], [[witchcraft]], and the evolution of [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

=== History ===

In an historical sense, Alchemy is the pursuit of transforming common metals into valuable gold.

{{main|Alchemy in history}}
The origins of Western alchemy are traceable back to [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Neumann, Erich]]. ''The origins and history of consciousness'', with a foreword by C.G. Jung. Translated from the German by R.F.C. Hull. New York : Pantheon Books, 1954. Confer p.255, footnote 76: &quot;''Since Alchemy actually originated in Egypt, it is not improbable that esoteric interpretations of the Osiris myth are among the foundations of the art ...''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leyden papyrus X]] and the [[Stockholm papyrus]] along with the [[Greek magical papyri]] comprise the first &quot;book&quot; on alchemy still existent.  [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] theorized that there were only four [[classical elements]] (rather than today's 117 [[chemical element]]s, a useful analogy is with the highly similar [[state of matter|states of matter]]); Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. The Greek philosophers, in order to prove their point, burned a log: The log was the earth, the flames burning it was fire, the smoke being released was air, and the smoldering soot at the bottom was bubbling water. Because of this, the belief that these four &quot;elements&quot; were at the heart of everything soon spread, only later being replaced in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Geber]]'s theory of seven elements, which was then replaced by the modern theory of chemical elements during the [[early modern period]].

[[Image:Alchemy-Digby-RareSecrets.png|thumb|right|Extract and symbol key from a 17th century book on alchemy. The symbols used have a [[Bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with symbols used in [[astrology]] at the time.]]

Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. Alchemy starts becoming much clearer in the 8th century with the works of the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic alchemist]], [[Geber|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (known as &quot;Geber&quot; in Europe), who introduced a [[Scientific method|methodical]] and [[experiment]]al approach to scientific research based in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were mainly allegorical.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Paul, Jâbir ibn Hayyân, ''Contribution à l'histoire des idées scientifiques dans l'Islam. I. Le corpus des écrits jâbiriens. II. Jâbir et la science grecque,''. Cairo (1942-1943).  Repr.  By Fuat Sezgin, (Natural Sciences in Islam. 67-68), Frankfurt. 2002:
{{quote|“To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir’s alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]].  One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us.  Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.”}}
{{quote|“The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen,  Tannery, Lagercrantz , von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail…}}
{{quote|The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging.  An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory:  even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.}}
{{quote|It is different with Jabir’s alchemy.  The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparatuses, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts.  The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the [[Ilm (Arabic)|`ilm]] and the [[Hope|`amal]].  In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented for example in the ''Book of Seventy''.”}}
([[cf.]] {{cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]|title=A Critical Reassessment of the Geber Problem: Part Three|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Geber/Geber%203.htm|accessdate=2008-08-09}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous alchemists include [[Wei Boyang]] in [[Chinese alchemy]]; [[Calid]] and [[Rhazes]] in [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic alchemy]]; [[Nagarjuna]] in [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|Indian alchemy]]; and [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[pseudo-Geber]] in European alchemy; as well as the anonymous author of the ''[[Mutus Liber]]'', published in France in the late 17th century, and which was a 'wordless book' that claimed to be a guide to making the [[philosopher's stone]], using a series of 15 symbols and illustrations. The philosopher's stone was an object that was thought to be able to amplify one's power in alchemy and, if possible, grant the user ageless immortality, unless he fell victim to burnings or drowning; the common belief was that fire and water were the two greater elements that were implemented into the creation of the stone.

In the case of the Chinese and European alchemists, there was a difference between the two. The European alchemists tried to transmute lead into gold, and, no matter how futile or toxic the element, would continue trying until it was royally outlawed later into the century. The Chinese, however, paid no heed to the philosopher's stone or transmutation of lead to gold; they focused more on medicine for the greater good. During Enlightenment, these &quot;elixirs&quot; were a strong cure for sicknesses, unless it was a test medicine. Most tests were generally fatal, but stabilized elixirs served great purposes. On the other hand, the Islamic alchemists were interested in alchemy for a variety of reasons, whether it was for the transmutation of metals or [[Takwin|artificial creation of life]], or for practical uses such as [[Islamic medicine]] or the [[Inventions in the Islamic world|chemical industries]].

A tentative outline is as follows:

#Egyptian alchemy [5000 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 400 BC], beginning of alchemy
#[[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]] [1200 BC&amp;nbsp;– Present]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] ([[Hindu]] sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy&quot; - Multhauf, Robert P. &amp; Gilbert, Robert Andrew (2008). ''Alchemy''.

== Modern connections to alchemy ==

[[Alchemy (Islam)|Islamic alchemy]] was a forerunner of modern scientific [[chemistry]]. Alchemists used many of the same laboratory tools that are used today. These tools were not usually sturdy or in good condition, especially during the medieval period of Europe. Many transmutation attempts failed when alchemists unwittingly made unstable chemicals. This was made worse by the unsafe conditions.

Up to the 16th century, alchemy was considered serious science in Europe; for instance, [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics, for which he is famous. Other eminent alchemists of the [[Western world]] are [[Roger Bacon]], Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Thomas Browne]], and [[Parmigianino]]. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational [[materialism]].

=== Alchemy in traditional medicine ===
Traditional medicines involve transmutation by alchemy, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques.  In [[Chinese medicine]] the alchemical traditions of [[pao zhi]] will transform the nature of the temperature, taste, body part accessed or toxicity.  In [[Ayurveda]] the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are used to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity.  These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear transmutation ===
{{main|Nuclear transmutation}}
{{main|Synthesis of noble metals}}

In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] used [[artificial disintegration]] to convert [[nitrogen]] into [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stmary.ws/physics/amsco_review_and_glencoe/chapter05.pdf|format=pdf |title= Reviewing Physics: The Physical Setting |author= Amsco School Publications |authorlink= http://worthyisthelamb.info/amsco/newtitles.html |format= |work= |publisher= Amsco School Publications |language= English |quote= &quot;The first artificial transmutation of one element to another was performed by Rutherford in 1919. Rutherford bombarded nitrogen with energetic alpha particles that were moving fast enough to overcome the electric repulsion between themselves and the target nuclei. The alpha particles collided with, and were absorbed by, the nitrogen nuclei, and protons were ejected. In the process oxygen and hydrogen nuclei were created.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, this sort of ''scientific transmutation'' has been routinely performed in many [[nuclear physics]]-related laboratories and facilities, like [[particle accelerator]]s, [[nuclear power station]]s and [[nuclear weapons]] as a by-product of [[fission]] and other physical processes.

=== In Literature ===

A play by [[Ben Jonson]], [[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]], is a satirical and sceptical take on the subject

Part 2 of [[Goethe]]'s [[Faust]], is full of alchemical symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;see Alice Raphael: Goethe and the Philosopher's Stone, symbolical patterns in 'The Parable' and the second part of 'Faust', London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Hermetic Fictions: Alchemy and Irony in the Novel'' ([[Keele University]] Press, 1995), by David Meakin, alchemy is also featured in such novels as those by [[William Godwin]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Emile Zola]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[James Joyce]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Lindsay Clarke]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Michel Butor]], [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Amanda Quick]].

=== In popular culture ===
{{cleanup|date=July 2009}}
The subject of alchemy is extensively used in many cartoons and comic books, often in the form of superpowers. In ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', alchemy and transmutation are treated as sciences, mixed with magic but fully understandable and utilizable with proper knowledge. ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' also refers to [[First Law of Thermodynamics|equivalency]] or equivalent exchange for alchemy to work. In ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', alchemy is used primarily as a means for superpowers, however it holds little resemblance to &quot;actual&quot; alchemy.

Alchemy is also used in many video games:

* In [[Might &amp; Magic VII: For Blood and Honour]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_VII:_For_Blood_and_Honor] Alchemy is a skill which characters can learn, which provides access to potion making, using ingredients with varying potency, using the skill level as a bonus; higher ranking allows access to more complex potions, up to &quot;black&quot; potions, which give characters a permanent boost in statistics, as opposed to a set period of time

* In [[World of Warcraft]], [http://www.wowwiki.com/Alchemy Alchemy] is a profession the player's character can learn in order to create special potions or flasks to be used for adding to the character's statistics for a set period of time, usually in preparation for big battles as in the case of instances/dungeons. 

* In [[Secret of Evermore]], the only video game from Square's North American division, alchemy takes the place of the normal magic system. The main character receives alchemic formulas instead of spells and by combining a wide variety of ingredients (such as wax, oil, limestone, and dry ice) a reaction will take place such as fireballs, healing, or shields. 

* The ''[[Atelier (series)|Atelier]]'' and ''[[Mana Khemia]]'' series from GUST also heavily emphasize on alchemy. The games feature hundreds of ingredient and recipes that players need to find or derive themselves. Additionally, all weapons and certain items must be made, or synthesized, and they are not sold in shops, which therefore makes alchemy essential in character growth. 

* The adventure game [[Zork Nemesis]] features a slightly stylised (to fit the fictional world of [[Zork]]) vision of alchemy, and uses knowledge of the processes as clues to solving puzzles.

* The Plot of the 2003 ''Core Design'' video game ''[[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness]]'' draws heavily from Alchemic lore and legend. 

* ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]],'' as the name would suggest, has as a central theme a magical stone (called the Philosopher's Stone) that is supposed to grant ever-lasting life and be able to turn anything to gold. For the American publication, the name was changed to &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; but the parallels between the book's magical stone and the alchemists' philosophers stone are still unmistakable. 

* ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]],'' by [[Paulo Coelho]], discusses one boy's quest to fulfill his destiny, and on the way he is aided by an alchemist.

* Another novel called ''The Alchemist'' by [[Donna Boyd]] explains the life of an immortal Egyptian going about life from Ancient Egypt to modern civilization.

* ''[[The Alchemyst: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]'' by [[Michael Scott]] centers on twins, Sophie and Josh Newman, who are guided through their prophesied quest by [[Nicholas Flamel]], a well-known alchemist in the 14th century.

* Short story by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] [1908] (1986). &quot;The Alchemist&quot;. in [[S. T. Joshi]] (ed.). ''[[Dagon and Other Macabre Tales]]'' (9th corrected printing ed.). Sauk City, WI: [[Arkham House]]. ISBN 0-87054-039-4. 

* Alchemy serves as one of the themes in [[White Wolf]]'s ''[[Promethean: The Created]]'' [[role-playing game]], using the humours, classical metals, and the ideas of refinement and the Magnum Opus as central ideas.

* In [[Star Wars]], the Sith have their own variation called ''[[Wookieepedia:Sith alchemy|Sith alchemy]]'', which calls upon the use of their magic to create hideous, [[Mutant|unnatural]] beasts of the dark side, summon forth [[monster]]s called Sithspawn, strengthen their weapons, and various acts of [[Zombie#Popular culture|corporeal]] [[Necromancy#Video games|necromancy]]. Darth Plagueis used this science to discover a technique similar to the real-world [[Elixir of life]].

* California band [[Thrice]] created a four EP set named the [[Alchemy Index]] which centers around each of the four elements involved in the alchemical process.

* In [[Venture Bros.]] a member of the Order of the Triad is The Alchemist, a character who is seeking the [[philosopher's stone]].

=== In contemporary art ===
In the twentieth century alchemy was a profoundly important source of inspiration for the Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]], who used the symbolism of alchemy to inform and guide his work. M.E. Warlick wrote his ''Max Ernst and Alchemy'' describing this relationship in detail.

Contemporary artists use alchemy as inspiring subject matter, like [[Odd Nerdrum]], whose interest has been noted by [[Richard Vine]], and the painter [[Michael Pearce]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callutheran.edu/schools/cas/programs/art/faculty/?profile_id=207 Cal Lutheran | Department of Art - Faculty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, whose interest in alchemy dominates his work. His works ''Fama'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.callutheran.edu/pearce/category/fama/ The Gilded Raven Blog + » fama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Aviator's Dream'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.callutheran.edu/pearce/category/storm-the-aviators-dream/ The Gilded Raven Blog + » Storm / The Aviator’s Dream&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly express alchemical ideas in a painted allegory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parracombe is the name of a Bagueley diesel locomotive that currently resides on the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] in the [[Isle of Man]] in private ownership.  It has not operated in service on the railway since arriving in 2007 from the [[Lynton and Barnstaple Railway]] in [[Devon]], where it had seen service on the [[Lynbarn Railway]] at the Milky Way theme park in [[Clovelly]]. It was built by Baguley (works No. 3232 of 1947) and once worked at [[Butlins]] [[Clacton]] Holiday Camp, from where it featured on the closing credits to the situation comedy [[Hi-De-Hi]] in the 1980s. Currently in store, it performed a very limited number of passenger services as part of an enthusiasts event in July 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Giulio Chazalettes''' (*1930) is an Italian [[opera]] [[director]] and former [[actor]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Verona]]&lt;ref&gt;http://delteatro.it/dizionario_dello_spettacolo_del_900/c/chazalettes.php&lt;/ref&gt; (according to another source in [[Torino]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayerische.staatsoper.de/309-ZG9tPWRvbTMmaWQ9NDIwJmw9ZW4-~popups~k_biographie.html&lt;/ref&gt;). He was taught in music by his mother, a [[German]] pianist. After having settled in [[Milan]], he was accepted by the [[Piccolo Teatro]]'s acting school. Soon he also joined the company, and appeared in ''Sacrilegio massimo'' by [[Stefano Landi]], and replaced [[Giorgio De Lullo]] in [[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]. Later he went to [[Dresden]] to work as an actor and assistant director. Returning to Italy, he finished his musical education at the [[Florence]] conservatory. Chazalettes then started his career as an opera director. In 1976, he debuted at [[La Scala]] with [[Massenet]]'s ''[[Werther]]'' (conducted by [[Georges Prêtre]]). His debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] came in 1980 with [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (conducted by [[Giuseppe Sinopoli]]). Chazalettes also worked for the [[Chicago Lyric Opera]] and the [[Bavarian State Opera]]. In 1989, he directed [[Frederica von Stade]] in Massenet's ''Cherubin'' for the [[Santa Fe Opera]], about which the [[New York Times]] wrote: ''&quot;Giulio Chazalettes's staging adopts a broadly comical, burlesque-opera approach that emphasizes Cherubin's lack of discrimination in woman-chasing. The countess (Melanie Helton) and the baroness (Judith Christin) fluttered about as painted gargoyles, their grotesqueness contrasting sharply with the beauty of the boy's other loves, the dancer L'Ensoleillad (Karen Huffstodt) and the peasant girl Nina (Sheryl Woods). Subtler production styles could be imagined, certainly, but this one often tickled the work hilariously into life.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/04/arts/review-opera-massenet-s-infrequently-performed-cherubin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Young Earth-Scientists for Society (YES) Congress 2009==

===Background:===
The Young Earth-Scientists for Society (YES) Network was formed in 2008. The network is an association of earth-scientists who are primarily under the age of 35 years that represent geological organizations and companies from across the world. In collaboration with the International Year of Planet Earth (IYPE) the YES Network is organizing the [http://www.yescongress2009.org/ first international YES Congress] that will focus on global climate, environmental and geological challenges facing today’s society, as well as career and academic pathway challenges faced by young geoscientists. The conference also aims to establish an interdisciplinary global network of individuals committed to solving these challenges, and furthering the IYPE motto of “Earth Sciences for Society”. 
The conference will be hosted at [http://www.cugb.edu.cn/cugbhomepage.asp China University of Geosciences] in Beijing, China from 25 to 28 October. 


===Format:===
====Oral and Poster Sessions====
The conference will provide poster and oral sessions that will focus around the ten main themes of the IYPE, as well as three additional themes that are unique to the conference: 

'''Oral and Poster Session Themes:'''
# Groundwater –towards sustainable use
# Hazards – minimizing risk, maximizing awareness
# Earth &amp; Health – building a safer environment
# Climate - the “stone tape”
# Resources –” towards sustainable use”
# Megacities – going deeper, building safer
# Deep Earth – from crust to core
# Ocean – abyss of time
# Soils – the living skin of the Earth
# Earth &amp; Life – origins of diversity
# The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift, changes and global changes
# Digital Earth Engineering
# Geoheritage Conversation and Geoparks

====Roundtable Symposia====
The conference will also provide roundtable symposia that aim to foster a prominent conversation between scientists, policy makers and society as a whole. The roundtables will include a series of short presentations by subject matter experts, a panel discussion and then working group sessions in which roundtable participants will work together to propose actions and tasks for the Y.E.S. Network to address in solving the issues raised by the roundtable session presentations and discussions. The roundtables will engage both senior and young geoscientists as both presenters and participants. Roundtables session deal with two main topics:  scientific challenges of our generation and academic and career pathway challenges for young geoscientists. 


'''Roundtable Symposia Themes: '''
* Climate Change in the Polar Regions 
* Natural Resources and Energy Sustainability 
* Natural Hazards 

* Transfer of Credentials / International Licensure 
* Issues Facing Global Geoscience Education and Research
* Women in the Geoscience Workforce
* Industry-Academic Linkages: Connecting the needs of the workforce with the tools of the classroom 

* Synthesis &amp; Strategy - Summary of Roundtable Sessions

      <text xml:space="preserve">Super Sailor Moon is Usagi Tuskino's second [[Sailor Moon]] form. Her Sailor Fuku almost completely changes than Sailor Moon's fuku. Her collar is still dark blue with two (three in the manga) yellow stripes. Her belt has a yellow belt on top, and her back bow was coloured lilac, enlarged and extended. Her skirt was white, with a thick blue stripe around the bottom edge, and a yellow thick stripe on top of the blue one. She had wing-like barrettes in front of her [[odango]] covers. Her choker is yellow with a red heart motif. In this form, her attacks are Rainbow Moon Heart Ache and her new attack, using the Kalaidemoon Scope, Moon Gorgeous Meditation.

She transforms in sync with [[Chibiusa]], who transforms into Super Sailor Chibi Moon. This form of Sailor Moon is shown until [[Sailor Moon Sailor Stars]], when she transforms into her next form, Eternal Sailor Moon.</text>

== '''Dois I. Rosser Jr.''' ==

Dois Rosser has a longtime career as a businessman in Hampton Roads birthed multiple auto dealerships, land development projects and numerous business ventures.  As he will quickly say, “all of my life in the business world was preparation for what God has for me now.”  As Dois sat at the feet of Pastor Dick Woodward in the late seventies, hearing Dick’s fresh approach to the scriptures, he became burdened to get the Word into the world.  He embarked on a project recording Pastor Woodward’s [http://www.minibiblecollege.org/ Mini Bible College].  This message was first broadcast in America, then throughout Central and South America, and is now translated in 26 languages spoken by over 4 billion people.  During a trip to India in 1986, Dois saw the immense need for providing solid places of worship for congregations whereby they could be nurtured in their faith.  This led him to build ICM’s first two churches.  Since then, over 2,900 churches are built or under construction in 48 countries throughout the world.

Dois currently serves as the chair emeritus and founder of [http://www.icm.org/ International Cooperating Ministries].  He previously served on the board of Trans World Radio, the Lausanne Conference for World Evangelism, and Leighton Ford Ministries, Youth Focus, Overseas Council for Theological &amp; Missions, Inc., and Prison Fellowship Ministries.  Time magazine awarded him its Virginia Quality Dealer Award in 2000; in 1989 he was elected Layman of the Year by the Religious Heritage of America.  In 1988 he received a National Brotherhood and Sisterhood citation from the National Conference of Christians and Jews.  In 1986 he was presented the Unsung Virginia award for his quiet contributions to his home community.  Dois was educated at the Walton School of Commerce in Chicago.  He lives in Hampton, Virginia, and has been married to the former Shirley Sutton since 1943.  They have three daughters, 2 sons in law and eight grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.</text>

This [[WP:BLP|BLP]] fails [[WP:BIO]]. His large format photographic prints are heavily marketed at a few retail shops in the US but there is little or no independent, non-sales-driven critical or in-depth commentary on this photographer. There is a long, uncited list of awards which don't seem to be [[WP:V|verifiable]]. Given these worries, article is also mostly an unencyclopedic [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]].

'''N-SAT-110''', also known as '''JCSAT-110''', '''Superbird-5''' and '''Superbird-D''', is a [[Japan]]ese geostationary [[communications satellite]] which is jointly operated by [[JSAT Corporation]] and [[Space Communications Corporation]]. It is positioned in [[geostationary orbit]] at a [[longitude]] of 110° East, from where it is used to provide communications services to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptvjsat.com/en/business/satellite/list/n_sat_110.html|title=N-SAT-110|publisher=Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_nsat_110.html|title=NSat 110|publisher=TSE|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

N-SAT-110 was built by [[Lockheed Martin]], and is based around the [[A2100AX]] [[satellite bus]]. It is equipped with 24 J band (IEEE Ku band) [[transponder]]s, and at launch it had a mass of {{convert|3531|kg}}, with an expected operational lifespan of around 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html|title=UCS Satellite Database|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/index_frame.htm?http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/nsat-110.htm|title=N-SAT 110 (JCSat 110, Superbird 5 (D))|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of N-SAT-110 was conducted by [[Arianespace]], using a [[Ariane 4|Ariane 44L]] carrier rocket flying from [[ELA-2]] at the [[Guiana Space Centre]]. The launch occurred at 23:00 GMT on 6 October 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;JSR-LL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully deployed N-SAT-110 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]], from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit by means of an onboard [[LEROS-1C]] apogee motor. Its insertion into geosynchronous orbit occurred at 03:00 on 14 October 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSOHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/geo.date|title=Index|work=Geostationary Orbit Catalog|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment''', ''ASLE India'', is envisioned as forum for the collective and intellectual pursuit of the human-nature nexus. Although the academic pursuit of the space that the human being inhabits—coterminous with the natural world—its intricacies and complexities have come to be interrogated in the academic circles in India (especially in the University circles) fairly recently after the historical evolution of ecological criticism (ecocriticism for short) in the  Anglo-American literary and theoretical spheres, the roots and ideas of this fast-enlarging field of inquiry extends deep into Indian cultural and aesthetic history as well. Be its revelation through the much-critiqued Vedic and Upanishadic verses couched in the Sanskrit idiom, or its manifestations through the variety of regional writing practiced variously over this rich and antique land, the diverse array of Indian art and its practice, ecology and environmental wisdom has been the natural heritage of this part of the world. ASLE India works towards a resuscitation of this vision—not through mere rehashing and reiterating but through a self-conscious inheritance, a deliberate recognition of history and culture. ASLE India attempts to interrogate even the very foundation and theoretical underpinnings of this disciplinary inquiry. It is open to the interventions of like-minded and serious scholars and intellectuals. The official Website of ASLE India is www.asleindia.webs.com

== Origin ==
[http://www.asleindia.webs.com/ ASLE India] was conceived on 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; January 2005 as a significant date- The first day of the Tamil New Year (the commencement of the harvest festival). it began with the meeting of a few scholars equally committed to nature and human nature. Its beginning marked the recognition of unity and diversity of universality and difference.

Polar Bear is a battery electric locomotive built by [[Alan Keef]] in [[2003]] for the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] in the [[Isle of Man]], where it currently resides.  It was built on the frame of a 1988-built vehicle of similar design (one of the last to be built) and has a newly-fabricated body replicating that of two similar locomotives that operated the railway between 1921 and 1926.  The original was built by [[Wingrove &amp; Rogers]] in [[1920]], and allocated works no. 314 and the operating replica is in original form.  However, the 1920 version proved troublesome and within the first season had been modified to include bogies to reduce the uncomfortable ride.  Further modification came with the addition of a battery truck that the loco pushed around, though the replica does not carry these later features.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Four new venues have been introduced for the third edition of the IPL, which will run from March 12 to April 25 next year. The 60-game tournament will feature a third-place playoff between the losing semi-finalists as a qualifier for the Champions League and could also see the induction of ICL players. The IPL governing council, which met in Mumbai on Tuesday, has also decided to include two new teams from the fourth edition in 2011.

Nagpur, Visakhapatnam, Ahmedabad and Dharamsala are the new venues, hosting some games of the Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, respectively. Hyderabad will stage the opening fixture between defending champions Deccan Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders, while both semi-finals will be held in Bangalore. The venue of the final hasn't been fixed but the season will end five days before the World Twenty20 opens in West Indies.

Today's decisions brought good news for the former ICL players, though their participation is subject to the BCCI's formal approval. They will now join the gravy train, though their payout could be considerably less than many of their peers. They will be valued in two categories; Indian domestic players will be paid Rs 8-20 lakh ($18,000-45,000) while international players, both Indian and foreign, will be made available through auction.

The IPL will also make use of the services of the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) for the third season. The BCCI had agreed to draft in ACSU for the upcoming Champions League in October as well, at the ICC board's annual conference in London last month.

Another development for the new season was the reduction in the 'strategic timeout' from seven-and-a-half minutes to five. The timeout - which will be mandatory for both sides - will be split into two breaks of equal length with the bowling team opting for it between overs 6-10, and the batting team allowed to choose between overs 11-16.

At his press conference following the meeting, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi also outlined plans for Season 4 onwards. Two franchises will be added to the league, through an auction to be held next January, and the tournament will expand from 60 games to 94. The player auction for the fourth season, with a new salary cap, will be held in the summer of 2010 to allow squads to integrate. The 'icon player' concept will be done away with but there will be no change in the number of international players - ten in the squad and four on the field.

The second season was held in South Africa in April-May this year after the Indian government declined to provide security because the tournament overlapped with general elections in the country.</text>

The '''1930-31 [[Rugby Football League]] season''' was the thirty first season of [[Rugby league|rugby league football]].

==Season summary==

Swinton won their third Championship when they defeated Leeds 14-7 in the play-off final.  They had also finished the regular season as league leaders.

The Challenge Cup Winners were Halifax who beat York 22-8.

The format of the competition was changed so that all clubs played the same number of matches, and percentages were done away with. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=350|title=1930-31 Season summary|accessdate=2009-08-08|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is closely related to the other natural sciences and, in a sense, encompasses them. Chemistry, for example, deals with the interaction of atoms to form molecules; much of modern geology is largely a study of the physics of the earth and is known as geophysics; and astronomy deals with the physics of the stars and outer space. Even living systems are made up of fundamental particles and, as studied in biophysics and biochemistry, they follow the same types of laws as the simpler particles traditionally studied by a physicist.

The emphasis on the interaction between particles in modern physics, known as the microscopic approach, must often be supplemented by a macroscopic approach that deals with larger elements or systems of particles. This macroscopic approach is indispensable to the application of physics to much of modern technology. Thermodynamics, for example, a branch of physics developed during the 19th century, deals with the elucidation and measurement of properties of a system as a whole and remains useful in other fields of physics; it also forms the basis of much of chemical and mechanical engineering. Such properties as the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas have no meaning for an individual atom or molecule; these thermodynamic concepts can only be applied directly to a very large system of such particles. A bridge exists, however, between the microscopic and macroscopic approach; another branch of physics, known as statistical mechanics, indicates how pressure and temperature can be related to the motion of atoms and molecules on a statistical basis (see Statistics).Physics emerged as a separate science only in the early 19th century; until that time a physicist was often also a mathematician, philosopher, chemist, biologist, engineer, or even primarily a political leader or artist. Today the field has grown to such an extent that with few exceptions modern physicists have to limit their attention to one or two branches of the science. Once the fundamental aspects of a new field are discovered and understood, they become the domain of engineers and other applied scientists. The 19th-century discoveries in electricity and magnetism, for example, are now the province of electrical and communication engineers; the properties of matter discovered at the beginning of the 20th century have been applied in electronics; and the discoveries of nuclear physics, most of them not yet 40 years old, have passed into the hands of nuclear engineers for applications to peaceful or military uses.</text>

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A privately owned Uk and European transport and removal firm, specialised in small removals and light haulage, created in England in 2007 by a French expatriate, Remi Girardin, who has been working in Transport in both France and England since 1993&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgts.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;.

With 5 vans, from 10 to 20 m3, they are assuring regular routes between France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Germany, and the Netherland; mainly for private individuals (motorbikes, furniture, lugage, boxes, bags,...) and also in cooperation with European businesses.

RGTS is also working in cooperation with French, English and Spanish universities, offering work placements to students in international business programs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bem.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hull.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urjc.es/&lt;/ref&gt;.

The company has been rapidly growing over the last two years, thanks to an exellent reputation and dedicated staff now composed of 4 drivers, 3 English employees and 2 French interns.

Furthermore, they recently moved into new premises in Taunton, Somerset, owned in cooperation with '''The wright removal company'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewrightremovalcompany.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;, and composed of a large warehouse and brand new offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yell.com/b/R.G.T.S-Removals+_+Overseas-Taunton-TA27DN-4920215/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''René Abjean''' (born 1937) is a French composer associated with [[Breton]] revivalist choral music.

==Life==
Born in Brest, René Abjean made his début as a musician in the choir of [[Plouguerneau]] in 1953. At 17 he created his first vocal work, as part of a choral group that was a cprecursor of the Bretob revivalism of Ar Baganiz and An Triskell, for whom he made many arrangements. He co-founded the Cercle Breton de Brest, and organised the ''Festival International des Cornemuses'' at Brest from 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Becker, Laure Le Gurun, &quot;La musique bretonne&quot;, Coop Breizh, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 


In 1974, il published a monograph on Breton music, wrote for several journals and contributed the chapter on Breton music in ''L’Histoire littéraire et culturelle de la Bretagne''. In 1975 he took over the leadership of the Ploudalmézeau choir , and in 1977 of that at Folgoët. These were later reconstituted as the &quot;Ensemble Choral du Bout du Monde&quot;, which he led until he passed it to Jo Le Gad in 1988.

In 1977, with Pierre-Yves Moign, he founded &quot;le Centre Breton d’Art Populaire&quot; in Brest, over which he presided from 1979 to 1981; he was also associated with the creation of Radio Bretagne Ouest (Radio Breizh Izel). He was a member of the New York Academy of Science from 1997 to 1999. He was decorated with the [[Order of the Ermine]]. He is married to Marie Kermarec.

==Compositions==
Abjean has written numerous sacred and secular choral works, often in the [[Breton language]], such as the ''Missa Keltia'' in 1975, the [[cantata]]s ''Ar Marc’h Dall'' in 1979, ''War Varc’h d’ar Mor'' in 1987 and ''Kan evit ar Peoc’h'' in 1989. He has also arranged sea shanties. He regularly works with the ''Chœur d’Hommes Mouezh Paotred Breizh'', creayed in 1993 by his friend Jean-Marie Airault. 1999 saw the creation of the cantata ''Une ville vers la mer'' to words by Heather Dohollau; in 2000 he wrote with Christian Desbordes a cantata for the millenium, ''Kalon ar Bed'' to words by Job an Irien. The cantata ''Liñvadenn Ker Is'' was created for the 50th anniversary of the &quot;fédération Kendalc’h&quot;. His 2004 cantata for the male choir &quot;Mouezh Paotred Breizh&quot;, &quot;Ce Pays vers la mer, Bro ar mor braz, this land and the sea&quot; was recorded in 2005 and distributed by Coop Breizh at [[Spézet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Four new venues have been introduced for the third edition of the IPL, which will run from March 12 to April 25 next year. The 60-game tournament will feature a third-place playoff between the losing semi-finalists as a qualifier for the Champions League and could also see the induction of ICL players. The IPL governing council, which met in Mumbai on Tuesday, has also decided to include two new teams from the fourth edition in 2011.

Nagpur, Visakhapatnam, Ahmedabad and Dharamsala are the new venues, hosting some games of the Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, respectively. Hyderabad will stage the opening fixture between defending champions Deccan Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders, while both semi-finals will be held in Bangalore. The venue of the final hasn't been fixed but the season will end five days before the World Twenty20 opens in West Indies.

The decisions brought good news for the former ICL players, though their participation is subject to the BCCI's formal approval. They will now join the gravy train, though their payout could be considerably less than many of their peers. They will be valued in two categories; Indian domestic players will be paid Rs 8-20 lakh ($18,000-45,000) while international players, both Indian and foreign, will be made available through auction.

The IPL will also make use of the services of the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) for the third season. The BCCI had agreed to draft in ACSU for the upcoming Champions League in October as well, at the ICC board's annual conference in London last month.

Another development for the new season was the reduction in the 'strategic timeout' from seven-and-a-half minutes to five. The timeout - which will be mandatory for both sides - will be split into two breaks of equal length with the bowling team opting for it between overs 6-10, and the batting team allowed to choose between overs 11-16.

At his press conference following the meeting, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi also outlined plans for Season 4 onwards. Two franchises will be added to the league, through an auction to be held next January, and the tournament will expand from 60 games to 94. The player auction for the fourth season, with a new salary cap, will be held in the summer of 2010 to allow squads to integrate. The 'icon player' concept will be done away with but there will be no change in the number of international players - ten in the squad and four on the field.

The second season was held in South Africa in April-May this year after the Indian government declined to provide security because the tournament overlapped with general elections in the country.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Equality Trust ==


The [http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/ Equality Trust] is an organisation that attempts to gain the widest public and political understanding of the harm caused by inequality.  Compelling new evidence shows that large income inequalities within societies damage the social fabric and quality of life for everyone.

This evidence is documented in a book written in 2009 by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilkinson_(public_health) Richard Wilkinson]] and Kate Pickett entitled the [http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846140396,00.html Spirit Level].  Based on thirty years of research it provides evidence on each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage births, and child well-being, showing for all eleven of these health and social problems, outcomes are very substantially worse in more unequal societies. 

The relationships have been verified, wherever possible, in two independent test beds: internationally among the rich countries, and then again among the 50 states of the USA. In almost every case it is found that the same tendency for outcomes to be much worse in more unequal societies in both the international and domestic USA settings. 

Evidence is presented on four other important issues. One is how achieving greater equality within the rich countries may contribute to tackling the inequalities between rich and poor countries. Another is a discussion of both the compatibility and relative merits of greater equality and economic growth as sources of improvements in the quality of life among rich countries. There is a page discussing how greater equality may contribute to policies designed to tackle global warming, and lastly, a page ([http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/why/remedies The Remedies]) pointing out that there are many different ways of increasing equality in our societies.
 
The data used comes from the most respected international sources including:

•	The World Bank
•	The World Health Organisation
•	The United Nations
•	UNICEF
•	The US Census Bureau

Much of this work has already been published in peer reviewed academic journals, and some of the relationships have been tested many times by different research groups using data for different societies. Details of the data and statistical techniques that are used are available on the [http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/why/evidence/methods Statistical Sources and Methods] page. The Equality Trust argues that in order to gain substantial improvements in the real quality of life of the populations of developed countries it is necessary that differences in income and wealth are greatly reduced.

The evidence suggests that this will improve health, dramatically reduce the incidence of violence and a wide range of other social problems, improve the quality of social relations for the vast majority of the population, and make the task of developing sustainable economic systems very much easier. 

However, the Trust believes that differences in income and wealth will only be reduced when there is a widespread public understanding of the benefits which greater equality can bring to everybody.  A program of public education is essential to generate the necessary political will among the electorate and politicians alike. 

The Equality Trust has been set up to fulfil that function. Their main task is to broaden and deepen people's understanding, change public attitudes and the climate of opinion, in order to bring more egalitarian pressures to bear on decision making in public and private institutions at all levels from the international to the local. 

In essence, The Equality Trust seeks to:

•	Promote employee-owned organisations and businesses;
•	Liaise with ethical investments funds to promote equality employers;
•	Commission research on equality issues;
•	Publish material relating to equality issues;
•	Lobby politicians and policy-makers at all levels;
•	Engage with all forms of the media to promote the equality message;
•	Give prizes at their Annual Conference for the best equality initiatives.</text>

'''Tropical Depression Two''' was the second [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2009 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It formed out of a [[tropical wave]] that came off of Africa, which developed on August 11th, 2009.

==Meteorological History==
Tropical Depression Two originated from a [[tropical wave]] that came off of Africa on August 8th, 2009. The [[National Hurricane Center]] took interest in it as it fought against [[Saharan Air Layer|dry air]], and after aquiring a [[Low-pressure area|closed low]], the National Hurricane Center declared the system Tropical Depression Two on August 11th, 2009.

just north of [[Roxy Ann Peak]]. The lake is formed by the {{convert|86|ft|adj=on}} tall Agate Dam, which impounds Dry Creek, in the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]].

==History==
Construction of Agate Dam was authorized in 1962, started in 1965, and completed in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;&gt;

The {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} tall earthfill [[embankment dam]] was completed by the Talent Division of the [[Rogue River Basin Project]], impounding Dry Creek. Two [[canal]]s were also built, diverting water from nearby Antelope Creek and [[Little Butte Creek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt; A [[boat ramp]], four [[pit toilet]]s, a [[picnic]] area, and a [[parking lot]] were also built. All but the boat ramp and parking lot have been removed due to excessive [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

==Statistics==
[[Image:Agate Lake Map.png|thumb|right|A map of Agate Lake]]
Agate Lake receives approximately {{convert|23|in|mm}} of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] annually. [[Temperature]]s average from highs of {{convert|89|F|C}} in the [[summer]] to lows of {{convert|22|F|C}} in the [[winter]]. The average [[wind speed]] in the area is {{convert|10|to|15|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

Agate Lake has an average surface area of {{convert|216|acre|km2}}, and an average volume of {{convert|4782|acre.ft|m3}}. It is located {{convert|1510|ft|m}} above sea level, although the water level fluctuates as much as {{convert|25|ft|m}} throughout the year. It has approximately {{convert|3|mi|km}} of [[shore]]line. The [[spillway]] has a capacity of {{convert|3300|ft3/s|m3/s}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

Agate Dam is {{convert|86|ft|m}} tall, {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|3800|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

==Flora and Fauna==
Dry Creek was [[Stream#Intermittent and ephemeral streams|intermittent]] prior to the construction of Agate Dam, and did not have any significant [[fish]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt;

==Recreation==
Non motorized [[boat]]s are allowed on the Agate Lake. [[Swimming]] and [[picnic]]king are also popular activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt;

The Jackson County Parks Department estimates that approximately 5,000 people visit the lake annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

== Thesis ==

The general fountainheads of economic success continue to trouble many aspects of the economy as a whole, among them being fuel prices, credit liquidity, consumer confidence, and unemployment. The transportation industry is by no means secluded from this recessionary cycle and in fact can be used as a harbinger itself; when no goods are demanded, high inventories remain stocked and dismiss the necessity for much transport.  Growth is expected to be recuperative as the global market in its entirety pulls itself from shambles. Although, not an economic boon scenario, year-to-year growth rates will be steady and indicative of a growth cycle. A caveat to this is that growth should not imply expansion of the industry, but instead a ‘convergence to the mean’; a boom-and-bust economy holds periods of irrational decline and inflation, yet also briefly sustain periods of normalcy, it is expected that 2010 will be a return to normal market behavior.


== GDP ==

	GDP, interestingly, often mimics freight traffic levels; as it is a measurement of both the economy and the growth of that economy. Historically, US GDP consistently grows each year, however near the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, GDP fell and, some might say, dramatically. During this period, GDP shrank 6% , a decline attributed to the compounding nature from the negative contributions from exports, and other declining investments, however imports, which subtract from the calculation, also decreased, mitigating the deterioration.   GDP is forecasted to reach a value of 14,139 [UNITS] by early 2010; this is a level comparable to early ’09, but still 13% short of mid ’08. What this indicates is a smoothing out of the GDP’s volatility and demonstrates the beginning of a rebound.  


== Index of Consumer Confidence ==

The index of Consumer Confidence is often used to predict future consumer spending and is drawn from a survey of 5,000 U.S. households. In mid-2009 the index was placed at 49.3 points, one of the higher levels in a year, but when looked on a larger scale another story is revealed. Mid-2007 index levels more than twice 2009 levels, hovering around 110 points. This implies that although mid-2009 is not as weak as before, it is still quite weak; it is estimated that a full recovery to mid-2007 levels won’t be existent until mid to late 2010.  


== Consumer Pricing Index ==

	The shipment of goods and products is inherently dependent upon those that want to consume the goods. The CPI can be used as an indicator to determine the underlying demand that fuel the logistical systems in this country, as well as the economy as a whole since consumer spending accounts for 70% of the US economy. The CPI right is rising slowly, yet using historical indicators one can assume the rise will be positive, but hovering around 1-2 % levels . As consumers’ nerves begin to calm from the financial shake-down and stock volatilities settle, one can assume economic reconciliatory patterns will emerge. This pattern will occur simultaneously at the top and bottom with executives rehiring and ramping up production and proletariat consumer will use their new-found discretionary funds to purchase goods, further emboldening the economy.



== Retail Sales ==

	Strong sales are often the pull from demand that creates air in the sails of the supply chain; retail sales tracking is one way to measure this. Although, it should be noted this is often more of a confirmation of recovery than it is an indicator, as there is a lag time in consumer response to economic events. Mid-2009 retail sales levels are on par with the levels seen in the previous six months, which, in the very least, is a sign of mitigating decline. Yet, when compared on a larger level, once again a different picture is painted; mid-2009 float around $340 billion in revenue, while a year early sales were around $375 billion, a disparity of more than 9% for all retail sales. 
	

== Manufacturing ==

	Manufacturing clearly has an impact on the transportation industry by creating goods or materials that need to be shipped. Manufacturing as a whole is seeing less demand than in previous years. Some, more cyclical industries, may have planned for this by creating backlog for harder times, yet non-cyclical firms would have a harder time doing this. Regardless of planning, however, the demand has not been there. Yet as a recovery takes place the sector is expected to rise consistently each month, emerging from the $.3 billion recent downturn. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is a compilation of data taken from a survey of several hundred US manufacturers and acts as an indicator of “on-the-ground” and near to mid-term expectations. An indication of growth would be a PMI above 50, contraction below 50 and any measure above 41.2 implies overall economic expansion. The PMI for the recent recession bottomed out at 32.9 in December ’08 and rose consecutively each month through ’09 to levels in between general economic expansion and the minimum for manufacturing-specific growth. PMI is expected to continue and quicken in pace to expansive levels. 


== Manufacturing Inventories and Sales ==

In an effort to pursue the most efficient and cost-saving structure, businesses will often attempt to maintain close levels of inventory with expected sales. However, as an unexpected economic crisis occurs, stock is less liquid as sales simultaneously diminish, creating a wide and often displeasing disparity between inventory and sales levels. This is represented in the comparison between the 2008 and 2009 sale/ inventory correlation. In mid-2008 inventory was 122% greater than sales, which appears consistent with usual proportions, but by mid-2009 the relationship had grown to 146%.  The illiquidity of the products turns this asset, which one has a future expected earning capabilities to a toxic liability that costs the owner money without delivering any ROI. 


== Index of Industrial Production ==

It is as important to examine the flow of raw material, in the transportation sector, as it is to look at the movement of goods and products; The Index of Industrial Production is a good proxy to review the exchanges from factories, mines, and electric utilities. The index displays a consistent month-to-month decline; in fact at the time of this report seventeen out of the last eighteen months had been negative and had seen a total Industrial Production decline of as much as -13.6%. However, the contracting are slowing each month as well; indicating the emergence out of a trough and, possibly, a recovery cycle. The upward momentum out of the red is inclining at a very fast pace with a ratio of 2/1.


== Capacity Utilization ==

As a symbol of overall slack in the economy with a specific focus on the industrial industries the capacity utilization among manufacturing, mining and utilities is a strong indicator. This index refers to the relationship between actual output that 'is' produced with the installed equipment and the potential output which 'could' be produced with it, if capacity was fully used. In theory, the higher the capacity utilization the less room there is to increase production w/out having to build a new plant or obtain new equipment; indicating strong economic output. 2009 represented a new all-time record low for this sixty-plus year old index, with a string of monthly lows preceding it, dropping from a historical level safely near 80%. As a caveat to these despairing records, is the recognition of a beginning of stabilization near 62% capacity utilization where it will, presumably, bottom-out and begin ascension towards regular levels.

== 
Port Security Grants (as an indication of growth) ==

	One might be able to use the number, and monetary value, of Port Security Grants issued by the Department of Homeland Security each fiscal year as an indication of the transportation’s industry expansion (or for that matter, contraction). As a reference point, seven grants were issued in 2006, three grants worth $567 million and two supplemental packets worth $260 million in 2007 and two grants worth $35 million in 2008.  However, because of slowed global transportation, this number dropped to zero in 2009. Making note of this decline, more than $150 million in stimulus funding was appropriated to the Port Security Grant issuing organization, FEMA’s Grant Programs Directorate. This additional funding has the intention of increasing management capabilities of port-wide infrastructure and provide immediate relief to communities impacted by unemployment and poverty. 
	

== Trucking   ==
                
----
       


== Oil Prices ==

	Debatably, the highest variable cost in the transportation industry is the cost of fuel. Oil prices have been volatile in recent memory, dropping down to US$34/barrel (of West Texas Intermediate, ‘WTI’, crude oil) in February ‘09 from ‘08 peak of US$145/barrel of WTI in July of the previous year. According to Energy Information Administration, an organization that offer official energy statistics from the U.S. government, has released data indicating a relatively stable projected price for WTI. 2009 prices are expected to average out around $70/ barrel of WTI, which will set the ending average $18 above the beginning average, indicating a convergence to normalized prices. 2010 is expected to bring prices further upward, albeit slightly, to an estimated average of $72/barrel of WTI; it interesting to note that this estimated price is very close to an averaging of  inflation-adjusted WTI barrel prices for the years from 2006 up-to 2010; statistically signifying a convergence to the mean. This is significant to notice, since, as a whole, 2010 will, presumably, be a crawl to normalcy from 2008’s exaggerated market state to 2009’s plummeting economy.


== For-Hire Truck Tonnage Index ==

	The trends in the FHTT index’s fluctuations imply a rebound, albeit a very slow and modest one. Tonnage levels have been dancing back and forth, although leaning forward, out of the year-to-year hole the recession produced for the industry. The industry is more leveling out than it is moving upward with tonnage levels expected to remain at current levels for the foreseeable future; probably caused by high levels of inventory still available in the supply chain. The current levels of inventory will continue to stall truck tonnage levels, but it unlikely to deteriorate any further due to modest growth. 

== Long-Distance Shipping ==

----


'''Intermodal'''
Intermodal rail volume is still expected to be in a declining state, but declining at diminishing levels each week, until the industry breaks free from just ‘turning around’. The levels of intermodal traffic from June 2009 (a historically average season) rested just below 190,000 intermodal units; compared to 230,000 units a mere year earlier.   

'''Rail'''
	The most recent data suggest that rail traffic across North America is poised to rebound and expected to enter a growth cycle out of a depressed state of decline that saw levels twenty-five percent lower than in previous years. Because the rail industry is a cyclical industry and thus greatly exposed to economic fluctuations and commodity price volatility, the overall industry is going to be greatly depressed to a severe degree. An example of this steep decline is represented in the Class I Railroad Employment numbers, where employment is a function of the level of business; i.e. how much freight is being hauled? Recent levels of employment fully represent an industry in a trough. In a three-year span rail road employees have fallen by more than 17,000 people, with a steep drop in late ’08, early ’09.  Considering all variables, however, US rail traffic is expected to begin emerging from 2009’s abyss, where rail volume was suppressed as low as 430,000 carload and intermodal units; whereas at this period in the four previous years, volume hadn’t been below 550,000 units. The rise, however, will undoubtedly be slow and by no means represent true industry growth.    
	
'''Railroad Cost Indices'''
The cost of shipping a product by rail decreased from 2008 to 2009 and is estimated to remain cheap through 2010. One of the more costly inputs, fuel, also fell by the highest percentage margin, a whopping 56.3%; other inputs such as materials/ supplies and wage/ fringe benefits rose slightly, but on par with usual rates. 



== Air Cargo ==


Air freight is a unique sector of the transportation industry, in the sense that its service is focused on the speed and distance of product delivery, not cost or bulk; because of this, airfreight has high operating costs, which can cause a dilemma in the face of economic turmoil. Overall the industry is delicate from recessionary effects, despite the sector’s relatively stable demand; additionally high-levels of inventory are diminishing any form of growth. If 2009’s pace continues through 2010, it will take several years to return to early 2008 levels. 


== Ocean Freight ==


'''Container Industry'''
Freight prices have dropped as shippers compete for a declining number of contracts and new vessels ordered during the boom period enter the market, effectively increasing global container-market capacity by 10%. Rates will be near 1990 levels, Kolding said, pushing operating margins to “record lows.” The container industry, as a whole, is estimated to contract 9-10% in 2010. An even more atrocious number contextually, with volume already dropping 24% the prior year. Industry leader, Maersk, has said that the balance between supply and demand won’t be enough to make a satisfactory profit until 2015.  
The HARPEX Index , which measures all good transported by container, will presumably bottom out as the overall global economy begins to recover. However, at the time of this report there has been a continual downslide in the index to never before seen levels in the indices’ 20-plus year history. Alternatively, the Baltic Dry Index , which measures “the demand for shipping capacity in relation to supply of dry bulk [commodities]” has had been showing clear signs of reaching a bottoming out point and perhaps will spearhead the climb towards solvency. 

In summation, when one examines data from the myriad of variables affecting the transportation industry, the sectors within that industry, and the economy as a whole, one can draw a fairly confident conclusion on the industry’s trend; convergence to the mean. 2010 will, undoubtedly, be a year of growth, but not expansion, where the economic indicators rise, but don’t signify development.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Michael Howard Studios''' is an [[acting studio]] for the [[performing arts]] located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]]; the studio was founded in 1953 by actor/director Michael Howard.

==History==
A protégé of both Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse and Lee Strasburg at the Actor’s Studio, Howard established his Studio in 1953 grounded in the work of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]].  Over the years, the studio incorporated many schools of thought and techniques from around the world.

The Studio attributes its existence to the [[Group Theatre]]. In 1931, Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasburg founded the [[Group Theatre]] in New York, beginning a watershed period in American Theater. The Group Theatre brought together [[Elia Kazan]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Sanford Meisner]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Irwin Shaw]], and [[John Garfield]] (among many others). Their creative commune introduced America to the revolutionary teachings of Stanislavski, and it set in motion new schools of thought that would dominate acting for the rest of the century. The Group Theatre closed its doors in 1941, and its visionary members set out in new directions. 

In 1942, [[Michael Howard (actor/teacher)]] joined the Neighborhood Playhouse as a scholarship student under [[Sanford Meisner]]. Howard vigorously pursued his studies and absorbed everything Meisner had to impart. Howard then served in World War II, and upon returning, joined Equity in 1947. [[Lee Strasburg]] invited Howard to study with him, and soon he was asked to become a member of the [[Actor’s Studio]]. Howard began a long career of hundreds of roles on stage and screen, including Odets’ “[[The Country Girl]]” on Broadway and the film “[[The Men]]” with Marlon Brando. Acting led to directing and, in 1952, to teaching, when [[Sidney Lumet]] asked Howard to replace him at the [[High School of Performing Arts]]. The next year, in 1953, a group of actors asked Howard to lead their sessions, and Michael Howard Studios was born.

Over the next five decades, Howard’s teachings expanded to the Yale School of Drama, the Julliard School, the American Conservatory Theatre, and Boston University while continuing his master classes at the Michael Howard Studios. 

The studio is now in it's 55th year in continuous operation making it the longest running private acting studio in New York.
In honor of the 55th anniversary of the studio, the studio received an official proclamation from Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] , declaring May 4, 2009 Michael Howard Studios Day &quot;in honor of the studio's contribution  to New York’s rich theatrical history&quot;.

'''Hospitality Law''' is the body of law relating to the foodservice, travel, and lodging industries.  That is, it is the body of law governing the specific nuances of [[hotels]], [[restaurants]], bars, spas, [[country clubs]], [[meeting and convention planners]], and more.  

Hospitality law doesn’t just involve one area of law.  It encompasses a wide variety of practice areas, including [[contracts]],[[ antitrust]], [[tort law]], and more.  

Recent events have made hospitality law even more relevant.  [[Food allergies]] are on the rise, making it increasingly important for restaurants to not only train staff about ingredients but to also have appropriate labels for food containing peanuts or wheat.  The [[Mumbai terrorist attacks]], which included a hostage situation at the Taj Mahal Hotel among other places, raise questions about what a hotel can legally do to ensure the safety of its guests.  

==Overview==
While hospitality law covers many different entities, hotels and restaurants are the two most common hospitality businesses.  

===Hotels===

Hotel operators in the United States have a duty to their guests and to their guests’ property.  

====Duty to Guest====

Lodging operators have a duty of care to their guests.  This duty does not insure the guests’ safety, but does require the operator to “act prudently and use reasonable care.”&lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009).  Hospitality Law.  p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; This means, among other things, that an operator can be held [[liable]] if he or she is found [[negligent]].  

An operator also must ensure that all of the guests’ personal information is retained and destroyed according to proper and recommended procedure.  

====Duty to Guest Property====

[[Common law]] held innkeepers liable for any loss of guest property when the guest was on their property.  Nearly all states have abrogated that duty, placing limits on an innkeeper’s liability, as long as the innkeeper complies with certain requirements.  These requirements, usually regulated in the state’s innkeeper statute, govern the placement of the law (many statutes require that the statute be placed in a common area, at the front desk, or behind the door of the room) and the size of the text of the displayed statute.  Generally, to be protected under the statutes, the innkeeper and his employees cannot be complicit in the theft or the loss of property.  Lastly, the innkeeper usually has to provide a safe for the safekeeping of the guests’ property.  

American statutes also govern [[bailments]].  A bailment is the “delivery of an item of property, for some purpose, with the expressed or implied understanding that the person receiving it shall return it in the same or similar condition in which it was received, when the purpose has been completed.” &lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009).   Hospitality Law.  p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Coat checks, safety deposit boxes, and luggage storage are common examples of bailments for the hospitality industry.  It is important for lodging and restaurant&lt;ref&gt; While the bailment section is discussed under lodging, the concept is also application to restaurant operators, since many have coat checks.&lt;/ref&gt;operators to understand that they are responsible for the safety of the guest’s property when a bailment is established.  

===Restaurants===

Restaurant operators in the United States have a duty to sell food that is merchantable, that is, suitable for buying and selling.&lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009).  Hospitality Law.  p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Truth in Menu” laws govern descriptions of food in menus.  These laws ensure that the customer receives what the menu says he or she will (e.g., one dozen oysters for a certain amount, instead of 11 oysters).  They also govern the ingredients, nutritional descriptions, preparation style, and more.  For example, a bill once introduced to the New York City Council required that the use of the words “homestyle” or “homemade” refer to dishes prepared “from scratch.”&lt;ref&gt; Jeffries and Banks.  Understanding Hospitality Law.  Fourth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government has had a long history of regulating food advertisement and sales.  In 2003, the [[FDA]] began to require labels to include trans fat content.  

The [[National Restaurant Association]] produces a helpful guide for restaurateurs - A Practical Guide to the Nutrition Labeling Law -to help the restaurant industry understand what nutrition claims it can make on its menu items.  

==Relation to Other Laws==

===Anti-Trust===

Antitrust laws regulate business conduct to preserve competition and to prevent economic coercion.  Hotel operators should not enter into an understanding regarding 1) room rates and conditions and terms of providing rooms or 2)  scope of operations.&lt;ref&gt; Jeffries and Banks.  Understanding Hospitality Law.  Fourth Edition.  p. 472.  Please see this resource for more specific examples of prohibited activity for operators. &lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to remember that a hotel operator is ordinarily responsible if its managers or employees violate antitrust laws.

===Contracts===

There are two main types of contracts applicable to the hospitality industry:  franchise contracts and management contracts.

A franchise agreement dictates the terms, rights, and responsibilities between the franchisee and the franchisor.    It covers termination policies, each party’s responsibilities, indemnification, and more.  Franchise agreements should be carefully reviewed by an attorney.

A [[management contract]] covers the duties and responsibilities between a management company and the business owner.  Management contracts covers fees, the management company’s investment or ownership, exclusivity, and more.&lt;ref&gt; Administration of Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management Contracts by James Eyster (1980) is a valuable resource for management contracts.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort Laws===

Torts, including negligence (as described above), intentional acts, [[assault]], and more, are also relevant for the hospitality industry.  Lodging operators need to be aware of their duties to guests in parking lots.  Restaurant operators that serve [[alcohol]] should also be aware of their duties to their guests when patrons become belligerent or hostile to each other or to other guests.  

==International Hospitality Law==

In many parts of the world, the hospitality industry is referred to as the “travel and tourism” industry or the “tourism” industry.  

Several global organizations are in place to improve and promote the global travel industry, including the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO).

&quot;'''Family Meeting'''&quot; is the 13th and final episode of the seveneth and final season of [[The Shield]]. The episode aired on FX on November 25th, 2008, and was written by [[Shawn Ryan]] and directed by [[Clark Johnson]]. The title comes from a line [[Shane Vendrell]] ([[Walton Goggins]]) calls to his family during the episode.

==Plot Summary==

The episode starts with Vic meeting Ronnie and telling him that the Shane didn't show up to the drop off and that Corinne was arrested. He also tells him that Olivia agreed to clear himself, Ronnie and Corinne once they arrest Beltran. They meet with Beltran and he agrees to meet with the black board of directors at the exchange.

Meanwhile, Dutch tells Corinne about the deal Vic made for full immunity which causes her to panic. He assures her that they have an idea to keep her safe from Vic if he finds out what she did to him.

Shane takes Mara and their son back to their house and they plan to leave the next day when the police are busy guarding the president.

Back at the barn, Claudette convinces Olivia to put Vic's family in federal protection to keep him away from them.

Vic goes to his house to tell Corinne that she is safe.

Shane shows up to surprise Billings and asks him to deliver a message. The message is that Mara shot the woman in self defense. He also tells him that he is willing to turn himself in and testify against Vic and Ronnie if they can guarantee immunity for Mara. He gives him an attorney's card and tells him to contact him.

At the exchange, Beltran doesn't show up and sends his men instead. This angers the black board of directors. The deal is about to go sour, so ICE moves in and arrests everyone. Olivia tells Vic that he is no longer involved and should back off the Beltran case. He decides to go after him, nonetheless, to honor his deal and Ronnie backs him up.

Lloyd show's up at the barn to report his mother: Rita, missing and Dutch believes he killed her. Lloyd says the last time he saw her was the night before and that she was upset about a fight she had with Dutch. He claims she left at 3 a.m. to go see Dutch at his house. Dutch tells Claudette about the mysterious hang up calls he got from Rita that made him go to her house the morning before. They believe Lloyd killed his mother and made those calls to implicate Dutch.

Julien and Tina respond to a noise complaint which is a rally for Robert Huggins, a local man running for mayor who they end up arresting. 

Shane calls the attorney and finds out that Claudette is only willing to offer reduced charges for Mara. He then calls Vic for help. Vic refuses and tells him about the deal he cut with ICE. Shane responds by telling him that Corinne was working with the police against him because she didn't want him near their children. Vic tells him that he'll check up on his children when he and Mara are in prison to tell them stories about what their parents did.

Olivia informs Vic that Corinne requested protection from him and that he would no longer be able to see his children.

Back at the barn, Claudette pulls Dutch off of the case after unis found burnt women's clothing in a trash container at his house. 

Robert Huggins makes bail and requests police protection since threats were made against him, but the request is ignored.

Billing's attorney meets with Dutch and asks him to change his statement because it's not helpful to his case against the department.

Shane buys flowers and a toy for Mara and Jackson.

Vic and Ronnie get Santiago to give up the location of Beltran. Vic suspected he would know where it is since he probably delivered the drugs instead of Beltran. He then calls Olivia to tell her the location but she refuses to help him.

Huggins interrupts a rally for Aceveda and questions him as a mayoral candidate.

Back at the barn, Billings is unable to get Lloyd to say anything and all the evidence points to Dutch. Dutch feels guilty for what he believes happened to Rita and asks for another shot at Lloyd. Claudette refuses and decides to interrogate him herself. She tells him she's convinced that Dutch may have had something to do with his mother's disappearance.

Back at the rally, Huggins continues to insult Aceveda until he is escorted out of the building.

Billing's attorney convinces Dutch to change his statement to keep Billings safe from the department's counter suit.

Shane goes back home and runs into a neighbor. He gives the presents he bought to his family. The neighbor calls the police and they go to his house. As soon as they enter, Shane kills himself with a revolver. They also find Mara and Jackson dead lying on the bed. There is a note next to Shane's body.

Shane calls Aceveda and asks him for help in arresting Beltran. He agrees after realizing it would be a good PR move for him that could get him more voters.

Vic and Ronnie head to Beltran's hideout and wait for ICE thinking that Aceveda would convince them to show up. However, they feel that Beltran is about to leave so they have to move in alone. They secure Beltran and his men and the ICE agents arrive. The drugs are found and Beltran is arrested.

Back at the barn, Billings thanks Dutch for changing his statement and informs him that he got a good settlement. Dutch later learns from his attorney that all he got was back pay for 2 days of missed work. She also gives him her card and tells him to call her some time!

At the warehouse, Aceveda arrives to talk with the press about the drug bust. Olivia tells Ronnie to get back to the barn where Vic knows he will be arrested.

Claudette tells Lloyd that she knows he's a murderer and that he's now a suspect in his mother's disappearance. She also reveals to Dutch that she's dying.

Tina and Julien respond to a call and find that Huggins has been shot. He dies in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

Vic shows up at the barn and gets dirty looks from everyone there. He finds Ronnie crying, who informs him about Shane killing himself and his family. Claudette asks to speak with Vic in the interrogation room and makes him sit on the suspect's side of the table. She tells Vic about the note Shane wrote and reads it to him: &quot;I guess enough painkillers can make even the worst kind of hurt go away. The thing you need to know is that Mara was innocent and Jackson was innocent; they didn't know what they were drinking and their last moments together were happy ones. They left the way I first found them, perfect and innocent. They were innocent and they are in heaven now and we'll always be a family. The guilty ones are me and Vic. Vic lead but I kept following. I don't think one's worse than the other, but we made each other into something worse than our individual selves. I wish I'd never met him. I see it all now. There is no apologies I can make, no explanations I can give. I was who I was and I can't be that person any more. I can't let myself...&quot;. The note is incomplete because he shot himself before he could finish it. Claudette tells Vic that she hope's he's proud of himself and shows him pictures of Shane and his family. Vic's face twitches and there is a long silence. He realizes that Claudette is watching him from the monitoring room so he rips out the surveillance camera and tells her to bill him for it on his way out. Claudette signals to Dutch and he proceeds to arrest Ronnie. Ronnie flips out when he learns of Vic's betrayal.

The next morning, Vic goes to ICE to start his new job. He asks Olivia about where his family is but she refuses to tell him. She then breaks the news that he won't be working on the streets for ICE. His job is to give daily reports about gang related activity. Vic refuses this desk job, but Olivia tells him that if he doesn't take the job for the next 3 years he will be prosecuted for all his confessed crimes.

At the barn, Aceveda tells Claudette that there is no truth to rumors that he was involved with Huggins' death. He asks her how she's holding up and tells her that they both spent a lot of time trying to put Vic away. She congratulates him on becoming mayor.

Vic returns to ICE in a suit and tie and is given a tour of his new work environment. He is visibly angry and upset.

A federal agent shows Corinne and her children their new home and describes the neighborhood. He tells them that the home is pretty basic, but Corinne thinks it's fine.

Back at the barn, the Unis have a small celebration for Tina's one year anniversary, which is soon interrupted by a robbery call.

Back at ICE, Vic, still visibly angry, places pictures of his children on his desk and a picture of himself and Lem. He smiles when he looks at the picture of Lem. He hears sirens and looks outside the window and sees some patrol cars. He returns to his desk and sits quietly for a while looking more and more emotional. He seems to be about to cry upon seeing the pictures of his children and thinking about everything that has happened to him. Finally, the lights go out, he takes his gun out of a lock box, puts on his jacket and leaves.

The episode ends with a montage of all the characters and events in the show.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/The+Shield/Family+Meeting/episode/1226034/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_recap&lt;/ref&gt;</text>

'''Ōtara''' is a suburb of [[Manukau City]], one of the cities which make up the [[Greater Auckland]] [[metropolitan area]] in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  Situated 18 kilometres to the southeast of Auckland city centre, Ōtara lies near the head of the [[Tamaki River|Tāmaki River]] (actually an arm of the [[Hauraki Gulf]]), which extends south towards the [[Manukau Harbour]].  Contemporary Ōtara is surrounded by the suburbs of [[Otahuhu|Ōtāhuhu]], [[Middlemore]], [[Papatoetoe]], [[Flat Bush]], and [[East Tamaki|East Tāmaki]].  The suburb is noted for its proportion of [[Pacific Islander]] residents, who make up 68% of the Ōtara population, and its unusually low number of [[New Zealand European]] ([[Pākehā]]) residents (13%).&lt;ref name=&quot;CENSUS2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.manukau.govt.nz/uploadedFiles/manukaugovtnz/Around_Manukau/Statistics/Otara%20Community%202006.pdf Otara Ward] (Census Profile 2006, [[Manukau City Council]]. Accessed 2009-08-10.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Māori Heritage==
In the [[Māori language]], ''Ō-Tara'' means ‘the place of Tara’ or ‘territory belonging to Tara’, who was a [[Rangatira]] (or [[Māori]] Chief) of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Tonson, A.E - ''Old Manukau'' - Auckland, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;  'Ōtara' is in turn the shortened form of '''Te Puke Ō Tara''' (literally; ‘The Hill of Tara’); known also for a time as Smales Mount.&lt;ref&gt;La Roche, Alan J. - ''A History of Puke O Tara (Smales Mt) and Hampton Park'' - Manukau, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Te Puke Ō Tara was one of Ōtara's prominent [[volcanic cone|volcanic cones]], and prior to European settlement in the area was the site of a [[scoria]] cone [[Pā]].  Like most of Auckland, the Ōtara landscape is volcanic in origin and forms a part of what is known as the East Tāmaki volcanic field, with Te Puke Ō Tara and Mātanginui (Greenmount) having been the dominant cones of Ōtara.  Mātanginui was also a Pā site, and the areas surrounding both Pā are thought to represent the densest area of pre-European settlement in East Tāmaki, favoured for rich volcanic gardening soils and fresh water springs.&lt;ref&gt;‘Alatini, Moses Ngaluapea - ''Housing and Related Social Conditions of the Tongan Community living in Otara'' - Auckland, 2004, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulmer, Susan - ''Sources for the Archaeology of the Maaori Settlement of the Taamaki Volcanic District'' - Wellington, 1994, p.39-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smytheman, I.F &amp; Tonson, A.E - ''Our First Hundred Years, An Historical Record of Papatoetoe'' Papatoetoe (1962), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tāngata whenua]] of Ōtara are the local [[iwi]] known as [[Ngāi Tai]] (also called Ngāti Tai).  Ngāti Tai are said to have originated as a distinct iwi identity on the eastern coastline of Auckland shortly after the [[Tainui (canoe)|Tainui]] [[waka]] called there in about the mid-14th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Geo. - ''Tainui'' in ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'' (Vol.60), 1951, pp.82-84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Pei Te Hurinui - ''Nga Iwi o Tainui'' - Auckland, 1995 (Ed. Bruce Biggs), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, G. J. - ''A History of the Human Occupation of the Whakakaiwhara Block'' - Auckland, 1996, pp.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taua, Te Warena in La Roche, Alan (Ed.) - ''The History of Howick &amp; Pakuranga'' - Howick, 1991, pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ngāi Tai tradition, Te Puke Ō Tara and Ōtara are named after the [[Ariki]] (Paramount Chief) of Ngāi Tai known as '''Tara Te Irirangi''', who lived from the late 18th Century until 1852.

Over time, with the emergence and expansion of later [[hapū]] and iwi identities, Ngāti Tai occupying the Ōtara area became closely interlinked by marriages with Te Akitai, Ngāti Tamaoho and Ngāti Kahu of the [[Tāmaki Makaurau]] confederation of tribes known collectively as Te Wai ō Hua, and with the [[Hauraki Gulf|Hauraki]] peoples of [[Ngāti Paoa|Ngāti Pāoa]] and [[Ngāti Tamaterā]], among others.  The Ngāti Pāoa chieftain Hauauru noted in 1851 that by the mid-1830s Ngāti Pāoa, Ngāti Tamaterā and Te Akitai had competing interests in Ōtara.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D., Rigby, B., and Russell, M. - ''Old Land Claims'' - Wellington ([[Waitangi Tribunal]]), 1997, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; While all of these groups hold ancestral relationships to the Ōtara area, Ngāi Tai continue to retain recognised [[mana|mana whenua]] status.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jennifer A. - ''East Tamaki: Including the Adjoining Areas of Flat Bush and Otara'' - Papatoetoe, 2002, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Settlement==
During the 1830s, Ōtara was among many present-day suburbs of Manukau &amp; Auckland originally included within the boundaries of what became known as the &quot;Tāmaki Block&quot; or &quot;Fairburn Purchase&quot;.  Between 1836 and 1839, the newly arrived Church Mission Society (CMS) missionary William Thomas Fairburn began moves to establish a mission station at [[Maraetai]] while attempting to purchase a vast tract of land from various iwi of Auckland.  Brokered as &quot;an act of Christian peacemaking&quot; between warring tribes on the Tāmaki isthmus, Fairburn obtained &quot;signatures&quot; to the deed of purchase from over 30 Rangatira; few, if any of whom could read or write.  Fairburn originally estimated the total area to contain 40,000 acres, but it was later surveyed as being around 83,000.  When the purchase came under scrutiny from the CMS, in 1837 Fairburn signed a deed promising to return one third of the land to the original inhabitants (a transaction which never took place), and unsuccessfully attempted to offer another third to the Church.  Following the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] establishing New Zealand as a [[British Colony]] in 1840, Fairburn came under investigation from the new Government's Land Claims Commission.  Following a protracted investigation (during which time Fairburn resigned from the mission), in 1848 the Commission disallowed Fairburn's original claim, awarding him instead a much smaller grant of just under 5,500 acres.  The remainder of the land, including Ōtara, was retained by the Crown as &quot;surplus land&quot; to be onsold to European settlers.  Following the protests of Hori Te Whetuki on behalf of Ngāi Tai, in 1854 the Commission granted a &quot;Native Reservation&quot; of just over 6,000 acres at Umupuia to &quot;the chiefs of the Ngatitai&quot; and paid them £500 compensation, on the condition that they sign an agreement to vacate all other lands within the original purchase boundaries, and order all other iwi to do the same.  

European settlement of Ōtara began in earnest from the 1850s onwards, with most settlers of the wider East Tāmaki area being comprised of Scottish and Irish [[Presbytarianism|Presbytarians]].  The most prominent settler of Ōtara during this period was the Wesleyan missionary Reverend Gideon Smales, who had arrived from England in 1840, and upon his retirement moved to settle at East Tāmaki, purchasing a 400 acre block from the Government in 1855, which included Te Puke Ō Tara.  Smales farmed the land at the foot of Te Puke Ō Tara and opened a quarry on the mountain; the entirety of which has since been destroyed.  Mātanginui Pā was also largely destroyed by quarrying from 1870 onwards and is now the site of the Greenmount Landfill.&lt;ref&gt;La Roche (2000), pp.1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulmer (1994), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Alatini (2004), p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  13 acres from the Smales Mount/Puke Ō Tara estate on the remains of the original cone now form reserve known as Te Puke Ō Tara Hampton Park, which includes a stone church built in the 1860s and the remains of extensive stone walls from Smales' farm, both constructed from the quarried scoria.

Farming and rural industries remained the dominant characteristic of Ōtara throughout the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.

==Urbanisation==
{{Expand section}}
Following World War II, Ōtara was developed by the Auckland Regional Authority as a State Housing area.

==Contemporary Culture==
{{Expand section}}
Ōtara is &quot;The Heart of Manukau City&quot; and the home of the &quot;Ōtara Global Village&quot; developing in the old relocated Baird's Intermediate school which was moved to the new site of the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate and renamed SEHC Middle School.

The suburb achieved a mild degree of worldwide fame with the one-off hit single ''[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]'', by hip-hop artists [[OMC (band)|OMC]]. &quot;OMC&quot; stands for &quot;Otara Millionaires' Club&quot; - a tongue-in-cheek reference to the low socio-economic status of much of the suburb, Ōtara being one of the poorest parts of the Auckland region - Ōtara North being Auckland Region's suburb with the second lowest median income, at NZ$25,900 after [[Great Barrier Island]] at NZ$25,100, and compared to an average of NZ$37,300 and the highest value of NZ$60,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10580186 We're getting richer but gap is widening] - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Tuesday 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōtara is also known for its Saturday morning '[[Flea market]]' held in the Ōtara shopping center car park next to [[Manukau Institute of Technology|Manukau Institute of Technology's]] South Campus.

In the 1970s [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Muldoon]]'s immigration policies led to [[dawn raid]]s on some Ōtara residents by police in the search for illegal overstayers from the Pacific Islands.

==Education==
Ōtara has two main high schools, [[Tangaroa College]] and [[Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate]].

Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate consists of three schools. The Junior School catering for Years 1 - 6; the Middle School, Years 7 and 8; and the Senior School catering for Years 9 - 13.

Ōtara is also home to [[Manukau Institute of Technology|Manukau Institute of Technology's]] two main campuses.

Ōtara has nine primary schools, [[Bairds Mainfreight Primary School]], Dawson School, East Tāmaki Primary School, Flatbush School, Mayfield Primary School, Rongomai School, Saint John the Evangelist School, Wymondley School and Yendarra School. Ōtara also has one intermediate school, Ferguson. It is also home to [http://www.piripono.school.nz Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Piripono].

Born in 1919, he was 25 at the time of the murders, and 90 at the time of his conviction by a German court (he had been convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 2006).

He served in the German army during World War Two and it was during that conflict that he ordered the capture and summary execution of ten civilians as a resprisal for the killing of two german soldiers under his command.

It was speculated at the time of his conviction that his may be last conviction for Nazi-era crimes.</text>

'''How It all Started.
Demarius Wallace Who Is known to some people as 4DAmbition.
Started rapping at the age of 5 in a small town known as Madisonville Texas.
He quit For 7 years, and then started getting back into the game of rap at the middle age of 13.
He knew a person that new somebody that could get him a career at the time.
But Sadly at the time 4DAmbition was just nearing the end of school and was trying to learn more about the rap game.
(Currently at the time 4DAmbition didn't know anything about rap names meaning who you are, or why you call yourself that.)
(He was also Focusing on sounding like Tupac Shakur, Who was known as 2Pac
For being the greatest Rapper of all time)
A Month Later he decided that he wanted to be more ''Original'' So he came up with the name Rebarius.
Which stood for the name of monster or a stone cold beast.
But He could not figure out a ''GOOD'' reason to call himself that so he came up with the name Reashaun.
2 Weeks later his cousin said that the name sounded like the name of a singer.
So he thought hard about it and came up with his New name ''4DAmbition''.
He's Currently wiriting songs known as '''''Major Swag Upgrade''''' '''''Swagger Inn''''' '''''Lots of recognition''''' and '''''Everybody Aint perfect'''''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A fleet of four-wheeled &quot;toastrack&quot; coaches were made for the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] on the [[Isle of Man]] between 1896 and 1905.  They were all supplied by G.F. Milnes &amp; Co. of [[Birkenhead]] and were of similar design and resemblde a smaller version of the trailers used on the [[Manx Electric Railway]] nearby, and were originally either varnised or painted a dark colour (contemporary postcards make it difficult to tell which) but the restored versions are varnished and carry no lining out, which is evident from early views.
[[Image:Ggr-coach.jpg|thumb|right|The line's resident re-built toastrack set with replica battery engine &quot;Polar Bear&quot;.]]

==&quot;A&quot; Coaches==
The original four-wheeled &quot;toastrack&quot; coaches supplied with &quot;Sea Lion&quot; in 1896 were never originally numbered but are known as the &quot;A&quot; coaches; there feature stone guards at rail level and a more plain valence design when compared to other coaches, though this was modified within the first year of operation as it is understood that the design was sufficiently prominent to allow passengers to bang their heads when boarding and alighting trains.  Today, there is one re-built 1896-type coach on the railway, carrying the number &quot;1&quot; but this bears no relation to original numbering, which varied from each repaint.  Two further original coaches reside at [[Amberley Chalk Pits Museum]] but these have flat roofs, whereas the resident one has a correctly curved roof.

==&quot;B&quot; Coach==
This was ordered owing to popularity of the line in the early years. This coach was slightly different from the others, having higher windows, different style valences, and is always known by its letter owing to these small differences; it remains to be re-built but several parts are in store, distinguishable from their odd dimensions when compared with the more standard fittings of the other coaches.  During the railway's centenary year in 1996 one of the [[1905]] built coaches that had been removed from the glen in 1967 and rebuilt at the [[West Lancashire Light Railway]] was returned to the line on loan, having since returned; it is to be noted that during its stay it carried a brass &quot;B&quot; in the bulkhead interior but this indicated &quot;borrowed&quot; rather than being the actual &quot;B&quot; coach, causing some confusion, the original having yet to be rebuilt.

==&quot;C&quot; &amp; &quot;D&quot; Coaches==
These were un-numbered originally and made up the final four coaches and arrived with Polar Bear in 1905 referred to as &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; type, the only major difference being the small style changed of valancing.  There are three restored coaches of this type with &quot;Polar Bear&quot; at Amberley Chalk Pits but the metalwork used is a mixture of all designs, and the result is something of a hybrid.  A further coach which serves as a disabled car.  A further original re-built coach is at the [[West Lancashire Light Railway]] but made a return to Groudle in 1996. There are currently two re-built 1905-type coaches resident on the [[Groudle Glen]] Railway which see regular service.

==Liveries==
It is understood from contemporary literature and limited photographic resources that the coaches delivered in 1896 were either varnished or painted in a dark colour.  Images purporting to be from opening day show the coaches with a light coloured lining-out on the valences and end panels, but no numbering is visible.  It is likely that if they were varnished this gave way to painting for appearance purposes.  The resident restored coaches are all varnished.  The set at [[Amberley Chalk Pits Museum]] are painted with black bulkhead panels, light brown valences, detailing and uprights, with further detailing in off-white, and grey floors.  It is not known whether this is an historically accurate livery or not.  By the final years of the line, the remaining servicable coaches appeared in a &quot;fairground&quot; livery of red and off-white (almost yellow), and evidence suggests that in the interim time they had recieved an all-over red/maroon colour scheme with white lining.

==Miscellaneous==
Owing to the number of newly fabricated parts on each site, both [[Groudle Glen]] and [[Amberley]], and a number of parts still in store, when the long-term project of completing the final coaches is done, it will result in there being more &quot;original&quot; coaches than there ever were on the railway.  A further 1896 coach is mid-way through being built, but the demise of the railway's in-house carpenter [[Harold Flavell]] in 2008 effectively ceased the project temporarily.  Each of the three resident coaches on the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] now carry brass plaques in memory of Mr. Flavell, who built all of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inheriting a title taken from the Infantas of Spain, Pedro Alcantara de Toledo y Salm Salm, XIII Duque del Infantado, was an extremely rich, powerful and popular figure in Spain generally and in court circles. He was ‘more educated than most of the Spanish grandees’&lt;ref&gt;A. Rabbe, Biographie Universelle (Paris, 1830)&lt;/ref&gt;, having been raised and schooled in Paris.
When Spain declared war on Revolutionary France in 1793, he raised an infantry regiment at his own expense.  He fought with it in Catalonia against the French beside a Portuguese division and commanded a brigade of the 2nd division of the army of Estremadura. After the treaty of Amiens, he used the peace to establish cotton mills in Catalonia using technical experts from England. In the following years he became very close to Ferdinand, the heir to the Spanish throne. This led him into conflict with the weak King Charles IV and his ambitious chief minister Godoy, and he was banished from Madrid in 1805. Within two years, and unfortunately for the Duke’s quiet life, Ferdinand was arrested and amongst his papers was found a nomination for the Duke to be Commander in Chief of the Spanish forces. Tried and sentenced to death as a traitor, he was reprieved by popular sentiment and the intervention of the French Ambassador.
A revolt in March 1808 resulted in the abdication of the king, the sacking of his manipulative chief minister Godoy and the ascent of Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throne, with the Duke of Infantado at his side. Taking advantage of the chaos, Napoleon ‘invited’ the factions including the Duke, to a conference in Bayonne. At this meeting a new Spanish constitution was signed by the assembled Spanish deputies that resulted in the throne passing to Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon’s brother. The only major Spanish figure that spoke in opposition was the Duke of Infantado, who ‘had opposed to the utmost any recognition of the foreign monarch’&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Recollections on the Private Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (The merriam Company, 1895)&lt;/ref&gt;. Not long afterwards the Duke called the nation to arms to resist the French, for which he was condemned as a traitor yet again, but this time by Napoleon. At the head of the Spanish army he was defeated by the French in 1809 at the battle of Ucles. His palace at Guadalajara and all his goods were confiscated by Joseph. The Duke joined forces with the British, at that time under Sir John Moore. He was extremely highly regarded by the British plenipotentiary, Mr J Hookham Frere, who was accustomed to late and inaccurate intelligence from his allies: ‘Had Sir John Moore been so fortunate as to find so candid a correspondent as the Duke of Infantado, a person who would describe things as they were, there is no doubt that the events and conclusion of the campaign would have been very different’&lt;ref&gt;J. Moore, A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain (J. Johnson, London, 1809)&lt;/ref&gt;, referring to Moore’s retreat to Corunna. Wellington later had much cordial correspondence with the Duke &lt;ref&gt;J. Gurwood, The Dispatches of The Duke of Wellington (London: John Murray, 1838)&lt;/ref&gt;during the later stages of the Peninsular War. Amusingly, but quite naturally for the times, all the correspondence between these allies during the war with France was in French.
In 1811 the Spanish parliament (the Cortes) nominated him as the President of the Council of Spain and sent him on a secret mission to the Prince Regent in London. He returned in 1812 and although he was proposed by Wellington as head of the 4th Army under British control, his enemies at the Spanish court decreed otherwise and he had to be content with leading his own regiment. After the end of the war with France in 1814 he retired again. He was recalled in 1823 to the Presidency of the Regency and was responsible for returning the king to the throne. Soon afterwards, tired of intrigue in the court and government, he retired to his country estates and eventually died there in 1841.
A postscript to the life of this leading Spaniard is less edifying. Pedro de Alcántara, the richest man in Spain, was succeeded firstly by his nephew who died childless after three years and then in turn by another nephew Mariano Téllez-Girón and Beaufort-Spontin (1814-1882), the 15th Duke of Infantado and the 12th Duke of Osuna. He was Spanish Ambassador in London, Paris and Moscow where the Russian Court were taken aback by his spending habits, reputably including bringing all his fresh flowers from Valencia to Moscow by train, throwing away clothes after one wearing and throwing solid gold dinner services into the Neva river after a banquet. His profligacy was such that one of his titles, Osuna, has been used as a Spanish byword for waste. All of his inheritance, the greatest fortune in Spain, was frittered in 38 years and at his death his personal possessions were auctioned to go towards paying his debts.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hotel Barges (Peniche Hôtel) ==
Following the decline in commercial and freight carriage on the canals of Europe many barges have been converted into floating hotels of varying degrees of luxury. This trend began in the 1960s and has now grown into a network of hotel barges operating on many of the canals and rivers of France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and the UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== History ==
When refering to travelling on the [[Canal du Midi]] in southern france [[Thomas Jefferson]], then ambassador to France before he became the third President of the United States, wrote to a friend almost 200 years before canal vacations became popular saying &quot;You should not think of returning to America without taking this tour I have taken&quot;. However, the practice of converting large barges (i.e. barges generally designed to fit into the locks of canals with minimal remaining volume) only began in 1966 with the Barge Palinurus, converted from carrying coal and captained by Richard Parsons on the canals of the Burgundy region of France. At the time the barge was equipped to take 20 passengers, with only one bath, two showers and two toilets shared between them, cruising on the River Yonne and the [[Burgundy Canal]] (Canal de Bourgogne).

The popularity of cruises, particularly amongst American clients, on this new type of boat was improved significantly thanks to the american writer Emily Kimborough and her book 'Floating Island' published in 1968, all about her experiences aboard the Palinurus. The high standards of accomodation expected by American clients rapidly drove the levels of luxury aboard hotel barges upwards. In 1969 Richard Parsons teamed up with Guy Bardet to launch Continental Waterways, a company that eventually ran 15 hotel barges in France.

3 decades later and the market for luxury vacations on floating hotels has grown even further, with over 200 cabins available on french canals alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== The 'Barging' Experience ==
Luxury Hotel barges have been cruising in Europe for over 30 years and are felt by many of their clients to be one of the most enjoyable, relaxing and luxurious ways of experiencing the country. Clients of the barges find that the waterways remain blissfully unspoilt and 'traffic-free'.  Usually cruising for a few hours each day, clientsl have time to take in all the sights and sounds, experiencing the wealth of history en route and catching a glimpse of times gone by.
Most hotel barges provide excursions in private vehicles that allow clients to enjoy local sights and experience the local culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Types of Hotel Barge Cruise ==
Hotel Barges come in a wide variety of sizes- some taking just four guests with others over 20 guests, with the size of accomodation varied to suit the physical dimensions of the hull. Levels of luxury range from 'comfortable Bed and Breakfast' right up to '5 star luxury, full board' with pricing to suit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Booking a Hotel Barge Holiday ==
The large number of barges, costs and variables in choice of accomodation mean that several brokers exist to help potential clients find which barge is right for their own vacation. These brokers are often based in the USA, with a few operating much closer to the barges in the UK and in France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Network Intelligence (NI)''' or '''Network Intelligence Technology (NIT)''' builds on the concepts and capabilities of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI) and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) to provide a more immediate and detailed understanding of data that transits communications networks. 

NI examines [[Packet_(information_technology)|IP data packets]] in real time by identifying the [communications protocols] used and extracting packet content and [[metadata]] for rapid analysis of data relationships and communications patterns. Its purpose is to harden network [[Computer_security|cyber security]] in enterprise and government environments, streamline current processes, and help businesses develop and manage new products and services that exploit [[Web_2.0|Web 2.0]] and wireless [[3G]] and [[4G]] technologies. 

NI extends the advancement of Internet business capabilities, security functions, and Internet [[data mining]]. Advocates of [[net neutrality]] who feared that DPI technology would be used to reduce the openness of the Internet will express the same reservations about NI, while NI advocates will argue that the technology will better protect lawful Internet users, enterprises and governments, and promote economic growth in telecommunications and other industries. NI is currently being incorporated into a wide range of applications by service providers, governments and large enterprises.

== Background ==
The evolution and growth of [[Internet]] and [[wireless]] technologies offer possibilities for new types of products and services,

Traditional DPI tools from established vendors like [[Sandvine]] and [[Allot]] have historically addressed network-focused applications such as [[bandwidth management]], [[Network_performance|performance optimization]] and [[Quality of Service]] (QoS). The expansion of real-time data capture and analysis capabilities with NI broadens the timeliness and depth of network visibility from these infrastructure-specific applications to commercial solutions such as mobile analytics, billing and policy management that rely on IP-based networks as platforms.


== Business Intelligence for data networks ==
In much the same way that BI technology synthesizes business application data from a variety of sources for business visibility and better decision-making, NI technology correlates network traffic data from a variety of data communication vehicles for network visibility, enabling better cyber security and IP services. 
With ongoing changes in communications networks and how information can be exchanged, people are no longer linked exclusively to physical subscriber lines. The same person can communicate in multiple ways – [[File_Transfer_Protocol|FTP]], [[Webmail]], [[Voice_over_Internet_Protocol|VoIP]], [[instant messaging]], [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[Social_network_service|social networks]] – and from different access points via desktops, laptops and mobile devices. 

NI provides the means to quickly identify, examine and correlate interactions involving Internet users, applications, and protocols whether or not the protocols are [[Tunnelling_protocol|tunneled]] or follow the [[OSI model]]. The technology enables a global understanding of network traffic for applications such as [[Lawful_interception|Lawful Intercept]] and [[Data_leakage_protection|Data Leakage Prevention]] that need to correlate information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, or who accesses what database, when, and the information viewed. When combined with traditional BI tools that examine service quality and customer care, this creates a powerful nexus of subscriber and network data.

== Use in Telecommunications ==
Telcos, [[Internet_Service_Provider|Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]] and [[Mobile_network_operator|Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)]] are under increasing competitive pressures to move to [[smart pipe]] business models. The cost savings and revenue opportunities driving smart pipe strategies also apply to [[Network_Equipment_Provider|Network Equipment Providers]], [[Independent_software_vendor|Software Vendors]] and [[Systems_integrator|Systems Integrators]] that serve the industry.  

Because NI captures detailed information from the hundreds of IP applications that cross mobile networks, it provides the required visibility and analysis of user demand to create and deliver differentiating services, as well as manage usage once deployed.

&lt;small&gt;NI as enabling technology for smart pipe applications&lt;/small&gt;

Customer metrics are especially important for telecom companies to understand consumer behaviors and create personalized IP services. NI enables faster and more sophisticated [[Audience_measurement|Audience Measurement]], User Behavior Analysis, [[Market_segment|Customer Segmentation]], and Personalized Services.

Real-time network metrics are equally important for companies to deliver and manage services. NI classifies protocols and applications from layers 2 through 7, generates metadata for communication sessions, and correlates activity between all layers, applicable for [[Optimization_(computer_science)|Bandwidth &amp; Resource Optimization]], [[Quality_of_service|Quality of Service (QoS)]], Content-Based Billing, [[Quality_of_experience|Quality of Experience (QoE)]], VoIP Fraud Monitoring and [[Regulatory_compliance|Regulatory Compliance]]. 


== Use in Cloud Computing ==
The economics and deployment speed of [[cloud computing]] is fueling rapid adoption by companies and government agencies.

Among concerns, however, are risks of [[information security]], [[e-discovery]], [[regulatory compliance]] and [[auditing]].

|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NI mitigates the risks by providing [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]],[[Platform_as_a_service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] and [[Software_as_a_service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]] vendors with real-time [[situational awareness]] of network activity, and critical transparency to allay fears of potential customers. A vendor can demonstrate hardened network security to prevent [[Data_leakage_protection|Data Leakage]] or [[Data Theft]] and an irrefutable audit trail of all network transaction  – communication and content – related to a customer’s account.

== Use in Government == 
NI correlates information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, or who accesses what database, when and the information viewed, providing [[situational awareness]] for [[Lawful_interception|Lawful Interception]] and [[Cyber_security|Cyber Security]]. Real-time data capture, extraction and analysis allow security specialists to take preventive measures and protect network assets in real time as a complement post-mortem analysis after an attack. 

== Use in Business == 
Because NI combines real-time network monitoring with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for [[Database_security|Database Security]], [[Database_audit|Database Auditing]] and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for [[Network_performance_management|Network Performance Management]], Network Optimization, [[Customer_experience_management|Customer Experience Management]], [[Content_filtering|Content Filtering]], and internal billing of networked applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''PowerSwim''' is a device somewhat like two pairs of long thin airplane wings which are fastened to a [[scuba diver]]'s hips and legs: the longer pair (about {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide or a bit less) at the hips and the shorter pair at the ankles. It was developed by [[DARPA]] in 2007. It is claimed to let a [[scuba diver]] or [[frogman]] swim much faster (250%) than with [[swimfin]]s for the same amount of bodily effort, if used correctly, and being not motorized, it makes no motor noise to be heard by hostile [[hydrophone]]s. It works somewhat like a [[penguin]]'s or [[plesiosaur]]'s side-mounted flippers. Its estimated cost is less than $500. The diver uses it by moving his legs up and down together like with a [[monofin]]. It is claimed that the length of the front wing lets it operate outside the cone of [[wake]] that starts at the diver's shoulders.

Likely disadvantages:
*The width of the device would make it difficult to go through narrow gaps or near alongside something.
*It ties the diver's feet together.

==Aqueon==
'''Aqueon'' or '''Aqueaon''' was a similar device to PowerSwim. It was primarily developed in the 1970s by the [[Innerspace Corporation]], an aquatic propulsion company which specialized in [[submersible]] thrusters at the time. The first working Aqueon unit was sold in 1979. Its original designer was [[California Institute of Technology]] graduate Calvin &quot;Cal&quot; Gongwer.  It was claimed to provide three times as much thrust as conventional [[Swimfin|swimming fins]] and up to six times as much power, and that from a stationary start, a swimmer covered 25 yards in 8.4 seconds using Aqueon, and that with an Aqueon the swimmer covered 1500 yards with [[scuba equipment]] in 24 minutes; the fastest time covered by the same diver with scuba equipment and fins was 44 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rykaipiy''' ({{lang-ru|Рыркайпий}}) is a rural locality just to the west of [[Mys Shmidta]] in the [[Shmidtovsky District]] ([[Raion]]) of the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], part of the [[Far Eastern Federal District|Far Eastern]] [[federal districts of Russia|Federal District]] of [[Russia]].

The village is a small settlement, population as of 2003: 324 &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot;&gt; [http://redcross-chukotka.ru/English/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=17] Red Cross Chukotka &lt;/ref&gt;, most of whom are of [[Chukchi]] descent. The name of the village means &quot;''Place of the Walrus''&quot; in [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], &lt;ref name=&quot;capetocape.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.capetocape.org.uk/Marker%20pages/Schmidta.htm] capetocape.org.uk &lt;/ref&gt;, or &quot;''Walrus Jam''&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;, to convey the meaning that there are regularly large numbers of [[Walrus]] in the vicinity. Unsurprisingly, marine hunting has traditionally been a key source of food and employment for the local indigenous people &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;.

As with several of the rural settlements thorughout Chukotka, Rykaipiy was the centre for a [[collectivization in the USSR|collectivised]] farm centred around [[reindeer]]. Indeed it was the central farmstead for the largest of all the reindeer herding famrs thorughout Chukotka, named ''Pioneer''. Unlike other rural settlements in Chukotka such as [[Alkatvaam]] in [[Beringovsky District]] and [[Tavaivaam]] in [[Anadyrsky District]], following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] and payments to the farms from the government effectively ceased as Russia moved to a [[market economy]], the workers on this farm were able to keep their reindeer herds going and these herds are still the major source of employment for the local people, despite living on the coast &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;.

As with many Chukotkan villages, there are strong efforts made to keep the traditions of the indigenous peoples alive and although Rykaipiy has modern facilities in the shape of a hospital, post office, high school and daycare centre there is also a traditional [[Chukchi]] ensemble and cultural centre and Northern Star Native Womens Club &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;.

Computing systems rarely deliver best possible performance due to ever increasing hardware and software complexity and limitations of the current optimization technology. Additional code and architecture optimizations are often required to improve execution time, size, power consumption, reliability and other important characteristics of computing systems. Iterative compilation based on empirical feedback-directed optimization became a popular approach to optimize programs for different objective functions on architectures with ever growing complexity, when traditional compilers fails to deliver the best possible performance. However, lack of common research methodology and tools makes it difficult or even impossible to reproduce experiments and compare techniques from a large number of research publications on this topic.

The main aim of the community-driven [http://ctuning.org Collective Tuning Initiative] is to develop collaborative production-quality research tools with unified API (http://cTuning.org/cTools) and enable sharing profitable optimization cases from the community in the open optimization repository (http://cTuning.org/cdatabase). Using common R&amp;D tools should help to improve the quality and reproducibility of the research of code and architecture design and optimization, and boost innovation in this area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hans Gabriel Booys''' (born 4 December 1951 in [[Rehoboth]], [[Hardap Region]]) is a [[Namibia]]n politician. A member of [[SWAPO]], Booys was selected to the [[National Assembly of Namibia|National Assembly]] replace [[Nathaniel Maxuilili]] after he died in a vehicle accident. Shortly after, he was elected in his own right in the [[Namibian parliamentary election, 1999|1999 election]]. He was once again re-elected in the [[Namibian parliamentary election, 2004|2004 election]]. In 2005 President [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] appointed him to serve on the Security Commission – the constitutional body, which makes recommendations to the President on top army and police appointments and other security matters. He is SWAPO’s Deputy [[Chief Whip]] in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=26 Hans Booys] at Namibia Institue for Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

Booys joined SWAPO in 1974. From 1982-1990, he was a literacy instructor for the [[Namibia Literacy Project]]. In 1990, he became a regional commissioner at [[Khorixas]], [[Kunene Region]]. From 1991-2002, Booys was a member of the [[SWAPO Central Committee]]. He lives permanently in [[Okahandja]].

Grime Daily was built from the heart of the UK grime and rap music scene, for the UK  music scene!  With the likes of World Star Hip Hop and Smack tube on the internet there was definitely a need for UK music from the underground to have a platform where people could actually see the artists.  Music visuals are very important as people want to be able to see the artists in the flesh to get a sense of the person, whether they are really like their music suggests, what kind of person they are? The UK music scene didn’t have any such platform!

Grime daily is trying to bring the UK music scene to a wider audience and wants to make sure UK grime music and underground UK music in general gets the recognition that it deserves. UK grime music and all of the other underground UK music’s such as  hip hop, UK funky, Drum and bass, Bassline, Dub step and anything else in the so called ‘UK urban scene’ gets out there and in peoples faces as there is some very good music out there to be heard.</text>

'''Ilija Grahovac''' called '''“Zmaj”''' (serbocroatian for Dragon) is a multiple awarded Cattle-breeder from a small Village near the town of Sipovo in the Republika Srbska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He became an internet celebrity after the appearance of a viral video showing him at his Fathers Funeral were he held a three-hour-long unrelated, strange and embarrassing speech and attacked people verbally who have shown anger about the length of the speech.
Soon these parts of the video found their way to the internet and made Ilija famous, this caught the attention of some TV-Stations which interviewed him, these interviews too were strange and also found their way to youtube and other portals.
This all led to a “sequel”,  Ilija recorded a new tape which was called “Dioba” in this film it is shown how Ilija and his Brother divide Cattle they have inherited from their father.
Also some of Ilijas Family and Neighbors are shown at his home, in this movie too there are shown Speeches which Ilija held while drinking Beer out of his winner-Cups, and it seems that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Weeks later there were seen unauthorized copys of the Funeral and Dioba in Bosnian Videoshops, wrapped in fan-made Covers.
There are rumors about a third Film with Ilija Grahovac which is said to be a porn-movie, but till today such a movie hasn’t emerged from the net and the rumors about its existence may be triggered trough another Video in which Ilija talks about his potency and strength in bed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article details the bogie coaches that operate on the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] on the [[Isle of Man]].  Forming the frontline service fleet for day-to-day operation these coaches were built in-house by the line's carpenters, on the frames of two coaches purchased from [[Doddington, Cheshire|Doddington Park]] in [[Chipping Sodbury]] when restoration began.  The original bodywork was deemed unsafe and not suitable for repair, although the coachwork was loosly based on this.

==No. 1==
The first coach to arrive in the glen in 1985 this coach was originally roofless.  It did not have brakegear initially, this being added in the third season of operation.  To overcome this, all trains ran with a four-wheeled &quot;bomb&quot; wagon at either end to provide braking.  By 1988 it had been fitted with an overall roof and valences to match the second coach, it remains in service today largely unaltered.

==No. 2==
Following the same pattern as No. 1 but having a roof fitted when built, this coach was delivered in time for the return of steam locomotive &quot;Sea Lion&quot; in 1987 and is largely identical to the first coach, save for having the braking equipment and associated guards' accomodation at the alternative end, meaning the coaches always run in the same formation with a guards' compartment at each extremity of the train.  Unaltered since arrival it remains in regular service today.

==No. 3==
The third coach which was completed and delivered in 1994 is only used at peak times and always rides between the other two coaches.  It is slightly different from the original two, owing to the proposed all-weather appearance which has not been executed.

==Livery==
All the coaches are painted in a maroon livery, the original two carrying G.G.R. lettering until repaint in 2001 when this was lost; however in 2007 all three coaches were fitted with the new railway crest; interiors are black painted bench seating with black (changed from grey in early 2008) floors, featuing a hand-brake at one end of the vehicle.

==Miscellaneous==
The coaches all feature a valance along their lengths using the same pattern as the original 1905 type coaches to give them a more authentic appearance. The coaches are numbered one to three but their fleet numbers are not immediately apparent as they are only painted on one end on the underframe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Panmure House''' was a country house in [[Monikie]], [[Angus]], [[Scotland]]. It was the seat of the [[Earl of Panmure]].

Panmure House was designed by the king's master mason [[John Mylne (1611-1667)|John Mylne]], although he died in 1667, before it was completed. The client was George Maule, 3rd Earl of Panmure (1650–1686). On Mylne's death, the work was continued by Alexander Nisbet, an Edinburgh mason, and the interior was fitted out by James Bain, the king's wright. Sir [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] was sometimes credited with the design in the past, and he did apparently advise the earl after Mylne's death, but he only designed the gates and gate piers.&lt;ref name=Gow&gt;Gow, pp.52–58&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the 3rd Earl, his son [[James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure|James]], now 4th Earl, added the wings. In the 19th century, the house was extended by [[David Bryce]] in the [[Scottish Baronial style]]. The house was demolished in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Gow/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Muljangori-oreum''' wetland is a mountain crater lake formed at the volcanic crater, which is at 900m~937m above the sea  level, 9km of the northeast side of Mt. Halla (1,950 m). The 628000m&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; lake provides water, which is not abundant on the island, to hawks, fairy pitas, black kites, Japanese lesser sparrow hawks, black paradise flycatchers and other rare animals

==Characteristics==
Muljangori-oreum is a parasitic cone formed by volcanic activities at the end of the third Cenozoic Era and exists only in Jeju island. Around Halla-san, about 370 parasitic cones are located and only about 30% of them has mountain craters. Oreum is mostly composed of water-permeable basalt, so it’s difficult to have a wet mountain crater lake on the top of Oreum.

The lake(Muljangori-oreum) 900m above the sea level maintains its surface water by the rainfall. During the dry season, most part of wetland becomes dry except the deepest hole in the south (about 50 m of water depth) and during the rainy season, most of it gets submerged under the water.

==Organisms==
'''Birds'''
* [[Peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus'')
* [[Fairy pitta]] (''Pitta brachyura nympha'')
* [[black kite]] (''Milvus migrans'')
* [[Japanese sparrowhawk]] (''Accipiter gularis'')
* [[Japanese paradise-flycatcher]] (''Terpsiphone atrocaudata'')
* [[obovata peony]] (''Paeonia obovata''). 
* [[Black paradise  flycatcher]] (''Terpsiphone atrocaudata'')
* [[Fabriciana nerippe]] (F:Papilionoidea) 
* [[Lethocerus deyrollei]] (F: Belostomatidae).


'''Plants'''
* Japanese strawberry tree (''Cornus kousa'' ), 
* Painted Maple (''Acer pictum subsp. monoi'' ), 
* Juncus effusus 
* Scripus triangulates, 
* Persicaria hydropiper.
