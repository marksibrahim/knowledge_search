Motive power is provided by a separate [[locomotive]] or individual motors in self-propelled [[multiple unit]]s. Although historically [[steam locomotive|steam]] propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric]] locomotives, the latter supplied by [[Overhead lines|overhead wires]] or [[Third rail|additional rails]]. Other energy sources include [[Horsecar|horses]], [[Cable railway|engine or water-driven rope or wire winch]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and [[gas turbine]]s. Train tracks usually consist of two running [[Rail profile|rails]], sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as [[Third rail|electric conducting rails]] and [[Rack railway|rack rails]], with a limited number of [[monorail]]s and [[magnetic levitation train|maglev]] guideways in the mix.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetic Levitation Trains|url=http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/mpa/stc/train.shtml|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=17 September 2014|quote=The electrodynamic suspension (EDS) levitates the train by repulsive forces from the induced currents in the conductive guideways.}}</ref> The word 'train' comes from the [[Old French]] ''trahiner'', from the [[Latin]] ''trahere'' 'pull, draw'.<ref>{{cite web | title = Train (noun) | work = (definition – Compact OED) | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}</ref> There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train may consist of a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and attached [[railroad car]]s, or a self-propelled [[multiple unit]] (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a [[railcar]]). The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s, while at about the same time self-propelled [[multiple unit]] vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service. A passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles which can often be very long and fast. One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. In order to achieve much faster operation over {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, innovative [[Maglev train|Maglev]] technology has been researched for years. In most countries, such as the United Kingdom, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law. The term [[light rail]] is sometimes used for a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[rapid transit|heavy rail rapid transit system]] except that it may have level crossings. A [[freight train]] (also known as a goods train) uses [[Railroad car#Freight cars|freight cars]] (also known as wagons or trucks) to transport goods or materials ([[cargo]]). Freight and passengers may be carried in the same train in a ''mixed consist''. Rail cars and machinery used for maintenance and repair of tracks, etc., are termed ''[[maintenance of way]]'' equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection. == Types == [[File:5051 Earl Bathurst Cocklewood Harbour.jpg|thumb|[[Steam locomotive]]-hauled passenger train]] [[File:390029 'City of Stoke-on-Trent' at Birmingham New Street.JPG|thumb|[[British Rail Class 390]] [[Electric multiple unit]] train]] [[File:Transperth Sets.JPG|thumb|A [[Transperth]] [[Transperth B-series train|B-series train]]]] [[File:Train Sudan towards Wau.jpg|thumbnail|right|Passengers travelling on the roof of a train in South Sudan]] There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train can consist of a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and attached [[railroad car]]s, or a self-propelled [[multiple unit]] (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a [[railcar]]). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity. Special kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are [[atmospheric railway]]s, [[monorail]]s, [[high-speed rail]]ways, [[Maglev train|maglev]], [[Rubber-tyred metro|rubber-tired underground]], [[funicular]] and [[Rack railway|cog railways]]. A passenger train may consist of one or several locomotives and coaches. Alternatively, a train may consist entirely of passenger carrying coaches, some or all of which are powered as a "[[multiple unit]]". In many parts of the world, particularly the [[Far East]] and Europe, [[high-speed rail]] is used extensively for passenger travel. Freight trains are composed of wagons or trucks rather than carriages, though some parcel and mail trains (especially [[Travelling Post Office]]s) are outwardly more like passenger trains. Trains can also be 'mixed', comprising both passenger accommodation and freight vehicles. Such mixed trains are most likely to occur where services are infrequent, and running separate passenger and freight trains is not cost-effective, though the differing needs of passengers and freight usually means this is avoided where possible. Special trains are also used for [[Rail tracks#Track maintenance|track maintenance]]; in some places, this is called maintenance of way. In the United Kingdom, a train hauled by two locomotives is said to be "double-headed", and in Canada and the United States it is quite common for a long freight train to be headed by three or more locomotives. A train with a locomotive attached at each end is described as 'top and tailed', this practice typically being used when there are no reversing facilities available. Where a second locomotive is attached temporarily to assist a train up steep banks or grades (or down them by providing braking power) it is referred to as '[[bank engine|banking]]' in the UK, or 'helper service' in North America. Recently, many loaded trains in the United States have been made up with one or more locomotives in the middle or at the rear of the train, operated remotely from the lead cab. This is referred to as "DP" or "Distributed Power." === Terminology === The [[railway terminology]] that is used to describe a 'train' varies between countries. ;United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the interchangeable terms '''set''' and '''unit''' are used to refer to a group of permanently or semi-permanently coupled vehicles, such as those of a [[multiple unit]]. While when referring to a train made up of a variety of vehicles, or of several sets/units, the term '''formation''' is used. (Although the UK public and media often forgo 'formation', for simply 'train'.) The word '''rake''' is also used for a group of coaches or wagons. In the United Kingdom Section 83(1) of the [[Railways Act 1993]] defines "train" as follows: :a) two or more items of rolling stock coupled together, at least one of which is a locomotive; or :b) a locomotive not coupled to any other rolling stock. ;United States In the United States, the term '''consist''' is used to describe the group of rail vehicles which make up a train. When referring to [[motive power]], '''consist''' refers to the group of [[locomotive]]s powering the train. Similarly, the term '''trainset''' refers to a group of [[rolling stock]] that is permanently or semi-permanently coupled together to form a unified set of equipment (the term is most often applied to [[passenger train]] configurations). There are three types of trains: Electric, Diesel and Steam. The [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]'s 1948 operating rules define a train as: "An engine or more than one engine coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers."<ref>{{cite book| author=Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway| title=Rules: Operating Department| year=1948| pages=7 }}</ref> == Bogies == [[File:Railroad truck,FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck (bogie) with [[journal bearing]]s]] {{Main|Bogie}} A '''bogie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɡ|i}} {{Respell|BOH|ghee}}) is a [[wheel]]ed wagon or trolley. In [[Machine|mechanics]] terms, a bogie is a [[chassis]] or [[Underframe|framework]] carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar [[tracked vehicle]]. Usually, two bogies are fitted to each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in articulated vehicles, which places the bogies (often jacobs bogies) under the connection between the carriages or wagons. Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using span bolsters to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars. Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker train to increase interior space while staying within height restrictions, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains. == Motive power == {{Main|Locomotive}} The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s, while at about the same time self-propelled [[multiple unit]] vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service. In most countries [[dieselization]] of locomotives in day-to-day use was completed by the 1970s. Steam locomotives are still used in a few locales where [[coal]] and labor are cheap, most notably the [[People's Republic of China]]. Steam powered [[Heritage railway]]s are operated in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market. Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Since the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is less viable for long-distance lines with the exception of long-distance high speed lines. Electric trains receive their current via [[overhead lines]] or through a [[Third rail|third rail electric system]]. A recent variation of the electric locomotive is the fuel cell locomotive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/blog2/index.php/hydrogen-vehicles/i-hear-the-hydrogen-train-a-comin-its-rolling-round-the-bend/|title=I Hear the Hydrogen Train a Comin', It's Rolling Round the Bend – Hydrogen Cars Now|author=Hydro Kevin Kantola|work=Hydrogen Cars Now}}</ref> Fuel cell locomotives combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation. However, there is a substantial initial cost of such [[fuel cell vehicle]]s. == Passenger trains == [[File:323godley.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class 323|Class 323]] at Godley]] [[File:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] in a long-distance train in [[Finland]]]] [[File:Passengers in Amtrak lounge car of San Joaquin (train) 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Passengers in the lounge car of an Amtrak [[San Joaquin Valley]] train, California, 2014]] A passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles which can often be very long and fast. It may be a self-powered [[multiple unit]] or [[railcar]], or else a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and one or more unpowered trailers known as [[passenger car (rail)|coaches, cars or carriages]]. Passenger trains travel between [[train station|stations]] or [[train station|depots]], at which passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed [[Public transport timetable|schedule]] and have superior track occupancy rights over [[freight train]]s. Unlike freight trains, passenger trains must supply [[head-end power]] to each coach for lighting and heating, among other purposes. This can be drawn directly from the locomotive's [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] (modified for the purpose), or from a separate [[diesel generator]] in the locomotive. For passenger service on remote routes where a head-end-equipped locomotive may not always be available, a separate generator van may be used.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Johnson | title = Head-end power | date = 1 May 2006 | url = http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/head-end-power | work = ABCs of Railroading | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nwrail.com/HEP_config.html| title=HEP Trainline Configurations in North America| publisher=''Northwest Rail''| accessdate=20 July 2015 }}</ref> Oversight of a passenger train is the responsibility of the [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]]. He or she is usually assisted by other crew members, such as service attendants or [[porter (railroad)|porters]]. During the heyday of [[North America]]n passenger rail travel, long distance trains carried two conductors: the aforementioned train conductor, and a [[Pullman Company|Pullman conductor]], the latter being in charge of [[sleeping car]] personnel. Many [[Luxury train|prestigious passenger train services]] have been given a [[List of named passenger trains|specific name]], some of which have become [[Famous trains|famous]] in literature and fiction. In past years, railroaders often referred to passenger trains as the "varnish", alluding to the bygone days of wooden-bodied coaches with their lustrous exterior finishes and fancy [[livery]]. "Blocking the varnish" meant a slow-moving freight train was obstructing a fast passenger train, causing delays. Some passenger trains, both long distance and short distanced, may use [[Bilevel car|bi-level (double-decker)]] cars to carry more passengers per train. Car design and the general safety of passenger trains have dramatically evolved over time, making travel by rail remarkably safe. === High-speed rail === [[File:Shinkansen 500 Kyoto 2005-03-19.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[Shinkansen]] [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 Series]] ([[High-speed rail]])]] {{Main|High-speed rail}} [[File:CRH380Afromshanghai.jpg|thumb|Chinese CRH380]] One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. Generally, high speed rail runs at speeds above {{convert|200|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds. [[Japan]]'s [[Shinkansen]] ("bullet-train") commenced operation in 1964, and was the first successful example of a high speed passenger rail system. The fastest wheeled train running on rails is [[France]]'s [[TGV]] (Train à Grande Vitesse, literally "high speed train"), which achieved a speed of {{convert|574.8|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, twice the takeoff speed of a [[Boeing 727]] [[jet airliner|jetliner]], under test conditions in 2007. The highest speed currently attained in scheduled revenue operation is {{convert|350|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} on the [[Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Rail]] and [[Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] systems in China. The TGV runs at a maximum revenue speed of {{convert|300|-|320|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, as does [[Germany]]'s [[InterCityExpress|Inter-City Express]] and [[Spain]]'s [[AVE]] (Alta Velocidad Española). In most cases, high-speed rail travel is time- and cost-competitive with air travel when distances do not exceed {{convert|500|to|600|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, as [[airport]] [[check-in]] and boarding procedures may add as many as two hours to the actual transit time.<ref>{{cite book| author=Central Japan Railway| title=Central Japan Railway Data Book 2006| year=2006| pages=16 }}</ref> Also, rail operating costs over these distances may be lower when the amount of [[jet fuel|fuel]] consumed by an [[airliner]] during [[takeoff]] and climbout is considered. As travel distance increases, the latter consideration becomes less of the total cost of operating an airliner and air travel becomes more cost-competitive. Some high speed rail equipment employs [[tilting train|tilting technology]] to improve stability in curves. Examples of such equipment are the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), the [[Pendolino]], the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], [[Amtrak]]'s [[Acela Express]] and the [[Talgo]]. Tilting is a dynamic form of [[superelevation]], allowing both low- and high-speed traffic to use the same trackage (though not simultaneously), as well as producing a more comfortable ride for passengers. === Double Deck Passenger Trains === [[File:VIRM6.jpg|thumb|On [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] there are many double deck trains such as the [[NS VIRM]].]] === Maglev === {{Main|Maglev (transport) }} In order to achieve much faster operation over {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, innovative [[Maglev train|Maglev]] technology has been researched since the early 20th century. The technology uses magnets to levitate the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing higher speeds. An early prototype was demonstrated in 1913, and the first commercial maglev train was an [[airport shuttle]] introduced in 1984. The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], opened in 2003, is the fastest commercial train service of any kind, operating at speeds of up to {{convert|430|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Maglev has not yet been used for inter-city [[Public transport|mass transit]] routes. === Inter-city trains === {{Main|Inter-city rail}} [[File:Tram arriving at a station in the US.jpg|thumb|A [[NJ Transit]] train arriving at the [[Camden (NJT station)|Camden]] station in [[Camden, New Jersey]], U.S.]] [[Passenger trains]] can be divided into three major groups: * [[Inter-city rail|Inter-city]] trains: connecting cities in the fastest time possible, bypassing all intermediate stations * [[Express train|Fast]] trains: calling at larger intermediate stations between cities, serving large [[Urban area|urban]] [[communities]] * [[Regional rail|Regional]] trains: calling at all intermediate stations between cities, serving all lineside [[communities]] The distinction between the types can be thin or even non-existent. Trains can run as inter-city services between major cities, then revert to a fast or even regional train service to serve communities at the [[wikt:extremity|extremity]] of their journey. This practice allows [[marginalization|marginal]] communities remaining to be served while saving [[money]] at the expense of a longer journey time for those wishing to travel to the [[Train station#Terminus|terminus]] station. ==== Regional trains ==== {{Main|Regional rail}} Regional trains usually connect between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs like inter-city trains, and serve local traffic demand in relatively [[Rural|rural area]]. ==== Higher-speed rail ==== {{Main|Higher-speed rail}} Higher-speed rail is a special category of inter-city trains. The trains for higher-speed rail services can operate at top speeds that are higher than conventional inter-city trains but the speeds are not as high as those in the high-speed rail services. These services are provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds. === Short-distance trains === ==== Commuter trains ==== [[File:Mumbai Train.JPG|thumb|[[Mumbai Suburban Railway|Mumbai's suburban trains]] handle 6.3 million commuters daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm|work=Official webpage of Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation|title=Overview Of the existing Mumbai Suburban Railway|accessdate=2008-12-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620033027/http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-20}}</ref>]] [[File:Jr t204standing.jpg|thumb|Interior of a 6-door passenger car in Japan, with bench seats folded]] {{Main|Commuter rail|Commuter rail in North America}} For shorter distances many cities have networks of [[commuter train]]s, serving the city and its suburbs. Trains are a very efficient [[mode of transport]] to cope with large traffic demand in a [[metropolis]]. Compared with road transport, it carries many people with much smaller land area and little air pollution. Some carriages may be laid out to have more standing room than seats, or to facilitate the carrying of [[Baby transport#Pushable vehicles|prams]], [[bicycle|cycles]] or [[wheelchair]]s. Some countries have [[Bilevel car|double-decked passenger trains]] for use in conurbations. Double deck high speed and sleeper trains are becoming more common in mainland Europe. Sometimes extreme congestion of commuter trains becomes a problem. For example, an estimated 3.5 million passengers ride every day on [[Yamanote Line]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan, with its 29 stations. For comparison, the New York City Subway carries 4.8 million passengers per day on 24 services serving {{NYCS const|number|total}} stations. To cope with large traffic, special cars in which the bench seats fold up to provide standing room only during the morning rush hour (until 10 a.m.) are operated in Tokyo ([[E231 series]] train). In the past this train has included 2 cars with six doors on each side to shorten the time for passengers to get on and off at station. Passenger trains usually have [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] handles (or a "communication cord") that the public can operate. Misuse is punished by a heavy [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]. === Long-distance trains === Long-distance trains travel between many cities and/or regions of a country, and sometimes cross several countries. They often have a [[dining car]] or restaurant car to allow passengers to have a meal during the course of their journey. Trains travelling overnight may also have [[sleeping car]]s. Currently much of travel on these distances of over {{convert|500|miles}} is done by air in many countries but in others long-distance travel by rail is a popular or the only cheap way to travel long distances. === Within cities === ==== Rapid transit ==== {{Main|Commuter rail in North America|Commuter rail|Rapid transit|Urban rail in the United Kingdom}} Large cities often have a [[rapid transit|metro]] system, also called underground, subway or tube. The trains are electrically powered, usually by [[third rail]], and their railroads are separate from other traffic, usually without [[level crossing]]s. Usually they run in tunnels in the city center and sometimes on elevated structures in the outer parts of the city. They can accelerate and decelerate faster than heavier, long-distance trains. The term '''[[rapid transit]]''' is used for public transport such as commuter trains, metro and light rail. However, in New York City, services on the [[New York City Subway]] have been referred to as "trains". ==== Tram ==== {{Main|Tram}} [[File:Adelaide Metro Glenelg Tram (Flexity Classic).JPG|thumbnail|right|Flexity Classic Tram, in Adelaide, Australia]] In the United Kingdom, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law. In the U.S. and Canada, such street railways are referred to as [[tram|trolleys]] or [[streetcar]]s. The key physical difference between a railroad and a trolley system is that the latter runs primarily on public streets, whereas trains have a [[Right of way (transportation)|right-of-way]] separated from the public streets. Often the U.S.-style [[interurban]] and modern [[light rail]] are confused with a trolley system, as it too may run on the street for short or medium-length sections. In some languages, the word ''tram'' also refers to interurban and light rail-style networks, in particular [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The length of a tram or trolley may be determined by national regulations. Germany has the so-called Bo-Strab standard, restricting the length of a tram to 75 meters, while in the U.S., vehicle length is normally restricted by local authorities, often allowing only a single type of vehicle to operate on the network. ==== Light rail ==== {{Main|Light rail}} The term [[light rail]] is sometimes used for a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[Rapid transit|subway]] except that it may have level crossings. These are then usually protected with crossing gates. In U.S. terminology these systems are often referred to as [[interurban]], as they connect larger urban areas in the vicinity of a major city to that city. Modern light rail systems often use abandoned heavy rail [[Right of way (public throughway)|rights of way]] (e.g. former railway lines) to revitalize deprived areas and [[redevelopment]] sites in and around large [[agglomerations]]. ==== Monorail ==== {{Main|Monorail}} [[File:Sydney Monorail 11.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sydney Monorails in Sydney, NSW. It ceased operations on 30 June 2013]] [[Monorail]]s were developed to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a relatively small part of the overall railway field. === Named trains === {{See also|Lists of named passenger trains}} Railway companies often give a name to a train service as a marketing exercise, to raise the profile of the service and hence attract more passengers (and also to gain [[Praise|kudos]] for the company). Usually, naming is reserved for the most prestigious trains: the high-speed express trains between major cities, stopping at few intermediate stations. The names of services such as the [[Orient Express]], the [[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]], the [[Flèche d'Or]] and the [[Royal Scot (train)|Royal Scot]] have passed into popular culture. Some of the popular specially named trains in India are: Brindavan Express (Chennai – Bengaluru), Deccan Queen (Mumbai V.T. - Pune) and Flying Ranee (Mumbai Central – Surat). Certain types of trains also are named in India, such as: * Rajdhani Express (National Capital, New Delhi, to a State Capital; fully airconditioned)) * Duronto Express (Fully airconditioned Non-stop 'Rajdhani' type trains between any two major cities) * Garib Rath (Fully airconditioned train with cut-down services and discounted fares for common man) * Shatabdi Express (Fully airconditioned short-distance Intercity Superfast; returns to the originating station by night) * Jan Shatabdi Express (An 'economy' version of the Shatabdi Express, with cut-down services and non-airconditioned coaches) A somewhat less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons. The "Condor" was an overnight [[London]]-[[Glasgow]] express goods train, in the 1960s, hauled by pairs of [[British Rail Class 28|"Metrovick"]] diesel locomotives. In the mid-1960s, [[British Rail]] introduced the [[Freightliner (UK)|"Freightliner"]] brand, for the new train services carrying [[containerization|containers]] between dedicated terminals around the rail network. The [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] also named freight trains, coining the term ''[[The Flying Kipper]]'' for the overnight express fish train that appeared in his stories in [[The Railway Series]] books. === Railbus === A [[railbus]] is a very lightweight type passenger rail vehicle that shares many aspects of its construction with a bus, usually having a modified bus body, and having four wheels on a [[Wheelbase|fixed base]], instead of on bogies. The are propelled by gasoline or diesel engines. The short distance between the vehicle floor and the ground allow railbuses to not need a special station to stop. Railbus designs developed in the 1930s. === Other types === ;Heritage trains {{Main|Heritage railway}} Heritage trains are operated by volunteers, often [[railfans]], as a tourist attraction. Usually trains are formed from historic vehicles retired from national commercial operation. ;Airport trains Airport trains transport people between terminals within an airport complex. ;Mine trains Mine trains are operated in large mines and carry both workers and goods. ;Overland trains [[Overland train]]s are used to carry cargo over rough terrain. == Freight trains == {{Main|Rail freight transport}} [[File:Cane Train.jpg|thumb|[[Sugar Cane|Cane]] train, [[Australia]]]] [[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[United Kingdom|British]] electric container freight train]] [[File:Freight train in Jacksonville, FL.jpg|thumbnail|right|A freight train passing through [[Jacksonville]], Florida]] A [[freight train]] (also known as goods train) uses '''[[Goods wagon|freight cars or freight wagons]]''' (also known as trucks or goods wagons) to transport goods or materials ([[cargo]])&nbsp;– essentially any train that is not used for carrying passengers. Much of the world's freight is transported by train, and in the United States the rail system is used more for transporting freight than passengers. Under the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is highly economic, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. Rail freight is most economic when freight is being carried in bulk and over long distances, but is less suited to short distances and small loads. Bulk aggregate movements of a mere twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) can be cost effective even allowing for [[Transshipment|trans-shipment]] costs. These trans-shipment costs dominate in many cases and many modern practices such as [[Intermodal container]] freight are aimed at minimizing these. The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. For this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to [[road transport|road competition]]. Many governments are now trying to encourage more freight onto trains, because of the benefits that it would bring. There are many different types of freight trains, which are used to carry many different kinds of freight, with many different types of [[Railroad car#Freight cars|wagons]]. One of the most common types on modern railways are container trains, where containers can be lifted on and off the train by [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and loaded off or onto [[truck]]s or [[ship]]s. In the U.S. this type of freight train has largely superseded the traditional [[boxcar]] (wagon-load) type of freight train, with which the cargo has to be loaded or unloaded manually. In Europe the [[Covered goods wagon#Sliding wall wagons|sliding wall wagon]] has taken over from the ordinary [[covered goods wagon]]. In some countries "[[Piggy-back (transportation)#Rail|piggy-back]]" trains or [[rolling highway]]s are used: In the latter case [[truck]]s can drive straight onto the train and drive off again when the end destination is reached. A system like this is used through the [[Channel Tunnel]] between [[England]] and [[France]], and for the trans-Alpine service between France and [[Italy]] (this service uses [[Gondola (rail)#Modalohr road trailer carriers|Modalohr road trailer carriers]]). "Piggy-back" trains are the fastest growing type of freight trains in the United States, where they are also known as "[[Semi-trailer|trailer]] on [[flatcar]]" or TOFC trains. Piggy-back trains require no special modifications to the vehicles being carried. An alternative type of "inter-modal" vehicle, known as a [[roadrailer]], is designed to be physically attached to the train. The original trailers were fitted with two sets of wheels&nbsp;— one set flanged, for the trailer to run connected to other such trailers as a rail vehicle in a train; and one set tyred, for use as the [[semi-trailer]] of a road vehicle. More modern trailers have only road wheels and are designed to be carried on specially adapted [[bogie]]s (trucks) when moving on rails. There are also many other types of [[Goods wagon|wagon]], such as [[well car|"low loader" wagons or well wagons]] for transporting road vehicles. There are [[refrigerator car]]s for transporting [[food]]s such as ice cream. There are simple types of [[Gondola (rail)|open-topped wagons]] for transporting [[mineral]]s and bulk material such as [[coal]], and [[tank car|tankers]] for transporting liquids and gases. Today, however, most coal and aggregates are moved in [[hopper car|hopper wagons]] that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials. Freight trains are sometimes illegally boarded by passengers who do not wish to pay money, or do not have the money to travel by ordinary means. This is referred to as "[[freighthopping]]" and is considered by some communities{{who|date=March 2011}} to be a viable form of transportation. A common way of boarding the train illegally is by sneaking into a train yard and stowing away in an unattended boxcar; a more dangerous practice is trying to catch a train "on the fly", that is, as it is moving, leading to occasional fatalities.
