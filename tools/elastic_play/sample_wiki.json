Motive power is provided by a separate [[locomotive]] or individual motors in self-propelled [[multiple unit]]s. Although historically [[steam locomotive|steam]] propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric]] locomotives, the latter supplied by [[Overhead lines|overhead wires]] or [[Third rail|additional rails]]. Other energy sources include [[Horsecar|horses]], [[Cable railway|engine or water-driven rope or wire winch]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and [[gas turbine]]s. Train tracks usually consist of two running [[Rail profile|rails]], sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as [[Third rail|electric conducting rails]] and [[Rack railway|rack rails]], with a limited number of [[monorail]]s and [[magnetic levitation train|maglev]] guideways in the mix.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetic Levitation Trains|url=http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/mpa/stc/train.shtml|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=17 September 2014|quote=The electrodynamic suspension (EDS) levitates the train by repulsive forces from the induced currents in the conductive guideways.}}</ref> The word 'train' comes from the [[Old French]] ''trahiner'', from the [[Latin]] ''trahere'' 'pull, draw'.<ref>{{cite web | title = Train (noun) | work = (definition \u2013 Compact OED) | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}</ref>\n\nThere are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train may consist of a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and attached [[railroad car]]s, or a self-propelled [[multiple unit]] (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a [[railcar]]). The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s, while at about the same time self-propelled [[multiple unit]] vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service.\n\nA passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles which can often be very long and fast.  One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. In order to achieve much faster operation over {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, innovative [[Maglev train|Maglev]] technology has been researched for years. In most countries, such as the United Kingdom, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law. The term [[light rail]] is sometimes used for a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[rapid transit|heavy rail rapid transit system]] except that it may have level crossings.\n\nA [[freight train]] (also known as a goods train) uses [[Railroad car#Freight cars|freight cars]] (also known as wagons or trucks) to transport goods or materials ([[cargo]]).  Freight and passengers may be carried in the same train in a ''mixed consist''.\n\nRail cars and machinery used for maintenance and repair of tracks, etc., are termed ''[[maintenance of way]]'' equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains.  Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:5051 Earl Bathurst Cocklewood Harbour.jpg|thumb|[[Steam locomotive]]-hauled passenger train]]\n[[File:390029 'City of Stoke-on-Trent' at Birmingham New Street.JPG|thumb|[[British Rail Class 390]] [[Electric multiple unit]] train]]\n[[File:Transperth Sets.JPG|thumb|A [[Transperth]] [[Transperth B-series train|B-series train]]]]\n[[File:Train Sudan towards Wau.jpg|thumbnail|right|Passengers travelling on the roof of a train in South Sudan]]\n\nThere are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train can consist of a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and attached [[railroad car]]s, or a self-propelled [[multiple unit]] (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a [[railcar]]). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity.\nSpecial kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are [[atmospheric railway]]s, [[monorail]]s, [[high-speed rail]]ways, [[Maglev train|maglev]], [[Rubber-tyred metro|rubber-tired underground]], [[funicular]] and [[Rack railway|cog railways]].\n\nA passenger train may consist of one or several locomotives and coaches. Alternatively, a train may consist entirely of passenger carrying coaches, some or all of which are powered as a \"[[multiple unit]]\". In many parts of the world, particularly the [[Far East]] and Europe, [[high-speed rail]] is used extensively for passenger travel. Freight trains are composed of wagons or trucks rather than carriages, though some parcel and mail trains (especially [[Travelling Post Office]]s) are outwardly more like passenger trains.\n\nTrains can also be 'mixed', comprising both passenger accommodation and freight vehicles. Such mixed trains are most likely to occur where services are infrequent, and running separate passenger and freight trains is not cost-effective, though the differing needs of passengers and freight usually means this is avoided where possible. Special trains are also used for [[Rail tracks#Track maintenance|track maintenance]]; in some places, this is called maintenance of way.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a train hauled by two locomotives is said to be \"double-headed\", and in Canada and the United States it is quite common for a long freight train to be headed by three or more locomotives. A train with a locomotive attached at each end is described as 'top and tailed', this practice typically being used when there are no reversing facilities available. Where a second locomotive is attached temporarily to assist a train up steep banks or grades (or down them by providing braking power) it is referred to as '[[bank engine|banking]]' in the UK, or 'helper service' in North America. Recently, many loaded trains in the United States have been made up with one or more locomotives in the middle or at the rear of the train, operated remotely from the lead cab. This is referred to as \"DP\" or \"Distributed Power.\"\n\n=== Terminology ===\nThe [[railway terminology]] that is used to describe a 'train' varies between countries.\n;United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, the interchangeable terms '''set''' and '''unit''' are used to refer to a group of permanently or semi-permanently coupled vehicles, such as those of a [[multiple unit]]. While when referring to a train made up of a variety of vehicles, or of several sets/units, the term '''formation''' is used. (Although the UK public and media often forgo 'formation', for simply 'train'.) The word '''rake''' is also used for a group of coaches or wagons.\n\nIn the United Kingdom Section 83(1) of the [[Railways Act 1993]] defines \"train\" as follows:\n:a) two or more items of rolling stock coupled together, at least one of which is a locomotive; or\n:b) a locomotive not coupled to any other rolling stock.\n\n;United States\nIn the United States, the term '''consist''' is used to describe the group of rail vehicles which make up a train. When referring to [[motive power]], '''consist''' refers to the group of [[locomotive]]s powering the train. Similarly, the term '''trainset''' refers to a group of [[rolling stock]] that is permanently or semi-permanently coupled together to form a unified set of equipment (the term is most often applied to [[passenger train]] configurations).\n\nThere are three types of trains: Electric, Diesel and Steam.\n\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]'s 1948 operating rules define a train as: \"An engine or more than one engine coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers.\"<ref>{{cite book| author=Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway| title=Rules: Operating Department| year=1948| pages=7 }}</ref>\n\n== Bogies ==\n[[File:Railroad truck,FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck (bogie) with [[journal bearing]]s]]\n{{Main|Bogie}}\nA '''bogie''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|o\u028a|\u0261|i}} {{Respell|BOH|ghee}}) is a [[wheel]]ed wagon or trolley. In [[Machine|mechanics]] terms, a bogie is a [[chassis]] or [[Underframe|framework]] carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar [[tracked vehicle]]. Usually, two bogies are fitted to each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in articulated vehicles, which places the bogies (often jacobs bogies) under the connection between the carriages or wagons. Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using span bolsters to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars. Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker train to increase interior space while staying within height restrictions, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.\n\n== Motive power ==\n{{Main|Locomotive}}\nThe first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s, while at about the same time self-propelled [[multiple unit]] vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service. In most countries [[dieselization]] of locomotives in day-to-day use was completed by the 1970s. Steam locomotives are still used in a few locales where [[coal]] and labor are cheap, most notably the [[People's Republic of China]]. Steam powered [[Heritage railway]]s are operated in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market.\n\nElectric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Since the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is less viable for long-distance lines with the exception of long-distance high speed lines. Electric trains receive their current via [[overhead lines]] or through a [[Third rail|third rail electric system]].\n\nA recent variation of the electric locomotive is the fuel cell locomotive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/blog2/index.php/hydrogen-vehicles/i-hear-the-hydrogen-train-a-comin-its-rolling-round-the-bend/|title=I Hear the Hydrogen Train a Comin', It's Rolling Round the Bend \u2013 Hydrogen Cars Now|author=Hydro Kevin Kantola|work=Hydrogen Cars Now}}</ref> Fuel cell locomotives combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation. However, there is a substantial initial cost of such [[fuel cell vehicle]]s.\n\n== Passenger trains ==\n[[File:323godley.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class 323|Class 323]] at Godley]]\n[[File:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] in a long-distance train in [[Finland]]]]\n[[File:Passengers in Amtrak lounge car of San Joaquin (train) 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Passengers in the lounge car of an Amtrak [[San Joaquin Valley]] train, California, 2014]]\nA passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles which can often be very long and fast. It may be a self-powered [[multiple unit]] or [[railcar]], or else a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and one or more unpowered trailers known as [[passenger car (rail)|coaches, cars or carriages]]. Passenger trains travel between [[train station|stations]] or [[train station|depots]], at which passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed [[Public transport timetable|schedule]] and have superior track occupancy rights over [[freight train]]s.\n\nUnlike freight trains, passenger trains must supply [[head-end power]] to each coach for lighting and heating, among other purposes. This can be drawn directly from the locomotive's [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] (modified for the purpose), or from a separate [[diesel generator]] in the locomotive. For passenger service on remote routes where a head-end-equipped locomotive may not always be available, a separate generator van may be used.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Johnson | title = Head-end power | date = 1 May 2006 | url = http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/head-end-power | work = ABCs of Railroading | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nwrail.com/HEP_config.html| title=HEP Trainline Configurations in North America| publisher=''Northwest Rail''| accessdate=20 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOversight of a passenger train is the responsibility of the [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]]. He or she is usually assisted by other crew members, such as service attendants or [[porter (railroad)|porters]]. During the heyday of [[North America]]n passenger rail travel, long distance trains carried two conductors: the aforementioned train conductor, and a [[Pullman Company|Pullman conductor]], the latter being in charge of [[sleeping car]] personnel.\n\nMany [[Luxury train|prestigious passenger train services]] have been given a [[List of named passenger trains|specific name]], some of which have become [[Famous trains|famous]] in literature and fiction. In past years, railroaders often referred to passenger trains as the \"varnish\", alluding to the bygone days of wooden-bodied coaches with their lustrous exterior finishes and fancy [[livery]]. \"Blocking the varnish\" meant a slow-moving freight train was obstructing a fast passenger train, causing delays.\n\nSome passenger trains, both long distance and short distanced, may use [[Bilevel car|bi-level (double-decker)]] cars to carry more passengers per train. Car design and the general safety of passenger trains have dramatically evolved over time, making travel by rail remarkably safe.\n\n=== High-speed rail ===\n\n[[File:Shinkansen 500 Kyoto 2005-03-19.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[Shinkansen]] [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 Series]] ([[High-speed rail]])]]\n{{Main|High-speed rail}}\n[[File:CRH380Afromshanghai.jpg|thumb|Chinese CRH380]]\nOne notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. Generally, high speed rail runs at speeds above {{convert|200|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds. [[Japan]]'s [[Shinkansen]] (\"bullet-train\") commenced operation in 1964, and was the first successful example of a high speed passenger rail system.\n\nThe fastest wheeled train running on rails is [[France]]'s [[TGV]] (Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse, literally \"high speed train\"), which achieved a speed of {{convert|574.8|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, twice the takeoff speed of a [[Boeing 727]] [[jet airliner|jetliner]], under test conditions in 2007. The highest speed currently attained in scheduled revenue operation is {{convert|350|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} on the [[Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Rail]] and [[Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] systems in China. The TGV runs at a maximum revenue speed of {{convert|300|-|320|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, as does [[Germany]]'s [[InterCityExpress|Inter-City Express]] and [[Spain]]'s [[AVE]] (Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola).\n\nIn most cases, high-speed rail travel is time- and cost-competitive with air travel when distances do not exceed {{convert|500|to|600|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, as [[airport]] [[check-in]] and boarding procedures may add as many as two hours to the actual transit time.<ref>{{cite book| author=Central Japan Railway| title=Central Japan Railway Data Book 2006| year=2006| pages=16 }}</ref> Also, rail operating costs over these distances may be lower when the amount of [[jet fuel|fuel]] consumed by an [[airliner]] during [[takeoff]] and climbout is considered. As travel distance increases, the latter consideration becomes less of the total cost of operating an airliner and air travel becomes more cost-competitive.\n\nSome high speed rail equipment employs [[tilting train|tilting technology]] to improve stability in curves. Examples of such equipment are the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), the [[Pendolino]], the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], [[Amtrak]]'s [[Acela Express]] and the [[Talgo]]. Tilting is a dynamic form of [[superelevation]], allowing both low- and high-speed traffic to use the same trackage (though not simultaneously), as well as producing a more comfortable ride for passengers.\n\n=== Double Deck Passenger Trains ===\n[[File:VIRM6.jpg|thumb|On [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] there are many double deck trains such as the [[NS VIRM]].]]\n\n=== Maglev ===\n\n{{Main|Maglev (transport) }}\nIn order to achieve much faster operation over {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, innovative [[Maglev train|Maglev]] technology has been researched since the early 20th century. The technology uses magnets to levitate the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing higher speeds. An early prototype was demonstrated in 1913, and the first commercial maglev train was an [[airport shuttle]] introduced in 1984.\n\nThe [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], opened in 2003, is the fastest commercial train service of any kind, operating at speeds of up to {{convert|430|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Maglev has not yet been used for inter-city [[Public transport|mass transit]] routes.\n\n=== Inter-city trains ===\n\n{{Main|Inter-city rail}}\n[[File:Tram arriving at a station in the US.jpg|thumb|A [[NJ Transit]] train arriving at the [[Camden (NJT station)|Camden]] station in [[Camden, New Jersey]], U.S.]]\n\n[[Passenger trains]] can be divided into three major groups:\n* [[Inter-city rail|Inter-city]] trains: connecting cities in the fastest time possible, bypassing all intermediate stations\n* [[Express train|Fast]] trains: calling at larger intermediate stations between cities, serving large [[Urban area|urban]] [[communities]]\n* [[Regional rail|Regional]] trains: calling at all intermediate stations between cities, serving all lineside [[communities]]\n\nThe distinction between the types can be thin or even non-existent. Trains can run as inter-city services between major cities, then revert to a fast or even regional train service to serve communities at the [[wikt:extremity|extremity]] of their journey. This practice allows [[marginalization|marginal]] communities remaining to be served while saving [[money]] at the expense of a longer journey time for those wishing to travel to the [[Train station#Terminus|terminus]] station.\n\n==== Regional trains ====\n{{Main|Regional rail}}\nRegional trains usually connect between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs like inter-city trains, and serve local traffic demand in relatively [[Rural|rural area]].\n\n==== Higher-speed rail ====\n{{Main|Higher-speed rail}}\nHigher-speed rail is a special category of inter-city trains. The trains for higher-speed rail services can operate at top speeds that are higher than conventional inter-city trains but the speeds are not as high as those in the high-speed rail services. These services are provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.\n\n=== Short-distance trains ===\n\n==== Commuter trains ====\n[[File:Mumbai Train.JPG|thumb|[[Mumbai Suburban Railway|Mumbai's suburban trains]] handle 6.3 million commuters daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm|work=Official webpage of Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation|title=Overview Of the existing Mumbai Suburban Railway|accessdate=2008-12-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620033027/http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-20}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Jr t204standing.jpg|thumb|Interior of a 6-door passenger car in Japan, with bench seats folded]]\n\n{{Main|Commuter rail|Commuter rail in North America}}\nFor shorter distances many cities have networks of [[commuter train]]s, serving the city and its suburbs. Trains are a very efficient [[mode of transport]] to cope with large traffic demand in a [[metropolis]]. Compared with road transport, it carries many people with much smaller land area and little air pollution.\n\nSome carriages may be laid out to have more standing room than seats, or to facilitate the carrying of [[Baby transport#Pushable vehicles|prams]], [[bicycle|cycles]] or [[wheelchair]]s. Some countries have [[Bilevel car|double-decked passenger trains]] for use in conurbations. Double deck high speed and sleeper trains are becoming more common in mainland Europe.\n\nSometimes extreme congestion of commuter trains becomes a problem. For example, an estimated 3.5 million passengers ride every day on [[Yamanote Line]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan, with its 29 stations. For comparison, the New York City Subway carries 4.8 million passengers per day on 24 services serving {{NYCS const|number|total}} stations. To cope with large traffic, special cars in which the bench seats fold up to provide standing room only during the morning rush hour (until 10 a.m.) are operated in Tokyo ([[E231 series]] train). In the past this train has included 2 cars with six doors on each side to shorten the time for passengers to get on and off at station.\n\nPassenger trains usually have [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] handles (or a \"communication cord\") that the public can operate. Misuse is punished by a heavy [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].\n\n=== Long-distance trains ===\nLong-distance trains travel between many cities and/or regions of a country, and sometimes cross several countries. They often have a [[dining car]] or restaurant car to allow passengers to have a meal during the course of their journey. Trains travelling overnight may also have [[sleeping car]]s. Currently much of travel on these distances of over {{convert|500|miles}} is done by air in many countries but in others long-distance travel by rail is a popular or the only cheap way to travel long distances.\n\n=== Within cities ===\n\n==== Rapid transit ====\n{{Main|Commuter rail in North America|Commuter rail|Rapid transit|Urban rail in the United Kingdom}}\nLarge cities often have a [[rapid transit|metro]] system, also called underground, subway or tube. The trains are electrically powered, usually by [[third rail]], and their railroads are separate from other traffic, usually without [[level crossing]]s. Usually they run in tunnels in the city center and sometimes on elevated structures in the outer parts of the city. They can accelerate and decelerate faster than heavier, long-distance trains.\n\nThe term '''[[rapid transit]]''' is used for public transport such as commuter trains, metro and light rail. However, in New York City, services on the [[New York City Subway]] have been referred to as \"trains\".\n\n==== Tram ====\n{{Main|Tram}}\n[[File:Adelaide Metro Glenelg Tram (Flexity Classic).JPG|thumbnail|right|Flexity Classic Tram, in Adelaide, Australia]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law. In the U.S. and Canada, such street railways are referred to as [[tram|trolleys]] or [[streetcar]]s. The key physical difference between a railroad and a trolley system is that the latter runs primarily on public streets, whereas trains have a [[Right of way (transportation)|right-of-way]] separated from the public streets. Often the U.S.-style [[interurban]] and modern [[light rail]] are confused with a trolley system, as it too may run on the street for short or medium-length sections. In some languages, the word ''tram'' also refers to interurban and light rail-style networks, in particular [[Netherlands|Dutch]].\n\nThe length of a tram or trolley may be determined by national regulations. Germany has the so-called Bo-Strab standard, restricting the length of a tram to 75 meters, while in the U.S., vehicle length is normally restricted by local authorities, often allowing only a single type of vehicle to operate on the network.\n\n==== Light rail ====\n{{Main|Light rail}}\nThe term [[light rail]] is sometimes used for a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[Rapid transit|subway]] except that it may have level crossings. These are then usually protected with crossing gates. In U.S. terminology these systems are often referred to as [[interurban]], as they connect larger urban areas in the vicinity of a major city to that city. Modern light rail systems often use abandoned heavy rail [[Right of way (public throughway)|rights of way]] (e.g. former railway lines) to revitalize deprived areas and [[redevelopment]] sites in and around large [[agglomerations]].\n\n==== Monorail ====\n{{Main|Monorail}}\n[[File:Sydney Monorail 11.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sydney Monorails in Sydney, NSW. It ceased operations on 30 June 2013]]\n\n[[Monorail]]s were developed to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a relatively small part of the overall railway field.\n\n=== Named trains ===\n{{See also|Lists of named passenger trains}}\nRailway companies often give a name to a train service as a marketing exercise, to raise the profile of the service and hence attract more passengers (and also to gain [[Praise|kudos]] for the company). Usually, naming is reserved for the most prestigious trains: the high-speed express trains between major cities, stopping at few intermediate stations. The names of services such as the [[Orient Express]], the [[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]], the [[Fl\u00e8che d'Or]] and the [[Royal Scot (train)|Royal Scot]] have passed into popular culture.\n\nSome of the popular specially named trains in India are: Brindavan Express (Chennai \u2013 Bengaluru), Deccan Queen (Mumbai V.T. - Pune) and Flying Ranee (Mumbai Central \u2013 Surat).\n\nCertain types of trains also are named in India, such as:\n* Rajdhani Express (National Capital, New Delhi, to a State Capital; fully airconditioned))\n* Duronto Express (Fully airconditioned Non-stop 'Rajdhani' type trains between any two major cities)\n* Garib Rath (Fully airconditioned train with cut-down services and discounted fares for common man)\n* Shatabdi Express (Fully airconditioned short-distance Intercity Superfast; returns to the originating station by night)\n* Jan Shatabdi Express (An 'economy' version of the Shatabdi Express, with cut-down services and non-airconditioned coaches)\n\nA somewhat less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons. The \"Condor\" was an overnight [[London]]-[[Glasgow]] express goods train, in the 1960s, hauled by pairs of [[British Rail Class 28|\"Metrovick\"]] diesel locomotives. In the mid-1960s, [[British Rail]] introduced the [[Freightliner (UK)|\"Freightliner\"]] brand, for the new train services carrying [[containerization|containers]] between dedicated terminals around the rail network. The [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] also named freight trains, coining the term ''[[The Flying Kipper]]'' for the overnight express fish train that appeared in his stories in [[The Railway Series]] books.\n\n=== Railbus ===\nA [[railbus]] is a very lightweight type passenger rail vehicle that shares many aspects of its construction with a bus, usually having a modified bus body, and having four wheels on a [[Wheelbase|fixed base]], instead of on bogies. The are propelled by gasoline or diesel engines. The short distance between the vehicle floor and the ground allow railbuses to not need a special station to stop. Railbus designs developed in the 1930s.\n\n=== Other types ===\n;Heritage trains\n{{Main|Heritage railway}}\nHeritage trains are operated by volunteers, often [[railfans]], as a tourist attraction. Usually trains are formed from historic vehicles retired from national commercial operation.\n\n;Airport trains\nAirport trains transport people between terminals within an airport complex.\n\n;Mine trains\nMine trains are operated in large mines and carry both workers and goods.\n;Overland trains\n[[Overland train]]s are used to carry cargo over rough terrain.\n\n== Freight trains ==\n{{Main|Rail freight transport}}\n\n[[File:Cane Train.jpg|thumb|[[Sugar Cane|Cane]] train, [[Australia]]]]\n[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[United Kingdom|British]] electric container freight train]]\n[[File:Freight train in Jacksonville, FL.jpg|thumbnail|right|A freight train passing through [[Jacksonville]], Florida]]\n\nA [[freight train]] (also known as goods train) uses '''[[Goods wagon|freight cars or freight wagons]]''' (also known as trucks or goods wagons) to transport goods or materials ([[cargo]])&nbsp;\u2013 essentially any train that is not used for carrying passengers. Much of the world's freight is transported by train, and in the United States the rail system is used more for transporting freight than passengers.\n\nUnder the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is highly economic, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. Rail freight is most economic when freight is being carried in bulk and over long distances, but is less suited to short distances and small loads. Bulk aggregate movements of a mere twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) can be cost effective even allowing for [[Transshipment|trans-shipment]] costs. These trans-shipment costs dominate in many cases and many modern practices such as [[Intermodal container]] freight are aimed at minimizing these.\n\nThe main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. For this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to [[road transport|road competition]]. Many governments are now trying to encourage more freight onto trains, because of the benefits that it would bring.\n\nThere are many different types of freight trains, which are used to carry many different kinds of freight, with many different types of [[Railroad car#Freight cars|wagons]]. One of the most common types on modern railways are container trains, where containers can be lifted on and off the train by [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and loaded off or onto [[truck]]s or [[ship]]s.\n\nIn the U.S. this type of freight train has largely superseded the traditional [[boxcar]] (wagon-load) type of freight train, with which the cargo has to be loaded or unloaded manually. In Europe the [[Covered goods wagon#Sliding wall wagons|sliding wall wagon]] has taken over from the ordinary [[covered goods wagon]].\n\nIn some countries \"[[Piggy-back (transportation)#Rail|piggy-back]]\" trains or [[rolling highway]]s are used: In the latter case [[truck]]s can drive straight onto the train and drive off again when the end destination is reached. A system like this is used through the [[Channel Tunnel]] between [[England]] and [[France]], and for the trans-Alpine service between France and [[Italy]] (this service uses [[Gondola (rail)#Modalohr road trailer carriers|Modalohr road trailer carriers]]). \"Piggy-back\" trains are the fastest growing type of freight trains in the United States, where they are also known as \"[[Semi-trailer|trailer]] on [[flatcar]]\" or TOFC trains. Piggy-back trains require no special modifications to the vehicles being carried. An alternative type of \"inter-modal\" vehicle, known as a [[roadrailer]], is designed to be physically attached to the train. The original trailers were fitted with two sets of wheels&nbsp;\u2014 one set flanged, for the trailer to run connected to other such trailers as a rail vehicle in a train; and one set tyred, for use as the [[semi-trailer]] of a road vehicle. More modern trailers have only road wheels and are designed to be carried on specially adapted [[bogie]]s (trucks) when moving on rails.\n\nThere are also many other types of [[Goods wagon|wagon]], such as [[well car|\"low loader\" wagons or well wagons]] for transporting road vehicles. There are [[refrigerator car]]s for transporting [[food]]s such as ice cream. There are simple types of [[Gondola (rail)|open-topped wagons]] for transporting [[mineral]]s and bulk material such as [[coal]], and [[tank car|tankers]] for transporting liquids and gases. Today, however, most coal and aggregates are moved in [[hopper car|hopper wagons]] that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.\n\nFreight trains are sometimes illegally boarded by passengers who do not wish to pay money, or do not have the money to travel by ordinary means. This is referred to as \"[[freighthopping]]\" and is considered by some communities{{who|date=March 2011}} to be a viable form of transportation. A common way of boarding the train illegally is by sneaking into a train yard and stowing away in an unattended boxcar; a more dangerous practice is trying to catch a train \"on the fly\", that is, as it is moving, leading to occasional fatalities. Railroads treat it as trespassing and may prosecute it as such.\n\n== Maintenance of way equipment and trains ==\n{{Main|Maintenance of way}}\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSee:\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Rail transport in fiction]]\n* [[List of train songs]]\n* [[Toy train]]\n* [[Train game]]\n* [[Rail transport modelling]]\n* [[:Category:Train simulation video games]]\n* [[V scale (model railroading)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Trains}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Rail transport]]\n* [[Armoured train]]\n* [[Famous trains]]\n* [[Luxury trains]]\n* [[Headboard (train)]]\n* [[Heaviest trains]]\n* [[History of rail transport]]\n* [[Hydrail]]\n* [[List of railway companies]]\n* [[Monorail]]\n* [[Rocket sled]] \u2013 rail mounted rockets\n* [[Unit train]]\n{{colend}}\n\n=== Rail accidents ===\n*[[Lists of rail accidents]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Glancey\n  | first = Jonathan\n  | title = The Train\n  | publisher = Carlton Publishing Group\n  | year = 2005\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n  | isbn = 978-1-84442-345-3}}, 256 pp.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikivoyage|tips for rail travel}}\n*{{Wiktionary-inline|train}}\n*{{Commons category-inline|Trains}}\n\n[[Category:Trains| ]]"}]}}}}

The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in [[starch]] covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant.  Almost all modern edible [[Parthenocarpy|parthenocarpic]] (seedless) bananas come from two wild species&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. The [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of most cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'', ''Musa balbisiana'', and ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' for the hybrid ''Musa acuminata'' \u00d7 ''M.&nbsp;balbisiana'', depending on their [[genome|genomic]] constitution. The old scientific name ''Musa sapientum'' is no longer used.\n\n''Musa'' species are native to tropical [[Indomalaya]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], and are likely to have been first domesticated in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name=apscience/>{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006}} They are grown in at least 107 countries,<ref name=fao/> primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make [[fiber]], [[banana wine]] and [[banana beer]] and as [[ornamental plant]]s.\n\nWorldwide, there is no sharp distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\". Especially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the [[#Cavendish|Cavendish group]], which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, [[List of banana cultivars|''Musa'' cultivars]] with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\". In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the simple two-fold distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants which produce the fruit.<ref name=MW/> This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'' like the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina'') and the [[Fe'i banana]]s. It can also refer to members of the genus ''[[Ensete]]'', like the [[Ensete glaucum|snow banana]] (''Ensete glaucum'') and the economically important [[Ensete ventricosum|false banana]] (''Ensete ventricosum''). Both genera are classified under the banana family, [[Musaceae]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Banana corm.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of a banana corm growing from loamy soil|A banana corm, about {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} across]]\n[[File:Banana farm Chinawal.jpg|thumb|upright|Banana farm at [[Chinawal]], India]]\nThe banana plant is the largest [[herbaceous]] flowering plant.<ref name=PicqINIB00/> All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"[[corm]]\".{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=5\u20139}} Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for [[tree]]s, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a \"false stem\" or [[pseudostem]]. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13\u201317}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=\"purdue1\"/> They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.<ref name=Greenearth/>\n\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9\u201313}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the [[Philippines]] produced five.<ref name=ABS_CBN/>) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244\u2013247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}\n\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3\u201320 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh {{convert|30|\u2013|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or \"finger\") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).\n\nThe fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".<ref name=Smit77/> There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three [[carpel]]s by manually deforming the unopened fruit.<ref name=Wark04/> In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.<ref name=Simm62/>\n\nBananas are naturally slightly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]],<ref name=Brod78/><ref name=ChemAbout/> more so than most other fruits, because of their potassium content and the small amounts of the isotope [[potassium-40]] found in naturally occurring potassium.<ref name=CassWu07/> The [[banana equivalent dose]] of radiation is sometimes used in nuclear communication to compare radiation levels and exposures.<ref name=ETR/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Banana Tree 01.jpg|Banana 'tree' showing fruit and inflorescence.\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana.JPG|Banana [[inflorescence]], partially opened\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana female flower detail.jpg|Female flowers have petals and other flower parts at the tip of the ovary\n</gallery>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word banana is thought to be of West African origin, possibly from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] word ''[[wikt:banaana|banaana]]'', and passed into English via Spanish or Portuguese.<ref name=OEtymD/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Nedravazhakola.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Musa'' 'Nendran' [[cultivar]] grown widely in the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]] is a member of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB cultivar group]]]]\nThe genus ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'' was created by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> The name may be derived from [[Antonius Musa]], physician to the Emperor [[Augustus]], or Linnaeus may have adapted the [[Arabic]] word for banana, ''[[wikt:\u0645\u0648\u0632|mauz]]''.<ref name=HyamPank95/> ''Musa'' is in the family [[Musaceae]]. The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.<ref name=Bail16/>\n\nThe classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. Subsequently further species names were added. However, this approach proved inadequate to address the sheer number of [[cultivar]]s existing in the primary center of diversity of the genus, [[Southeast Asia]]. Many of these cultivars were given names which proved to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}\n\nIn a series of papers published in 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were actually cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].<ref name=DRC/> He recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars \u2013 those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics that are the combination of the two.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities today, leading to confusion.<ref name=DRC/><ref name=Porc02/>\n\nThe currently accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are '''''Musa acuminata''''' <small>Colla</small> and '''''Musa balbisiana''''' <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and '''''Musa'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca''''' <small>L.</small> for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' \u00d7 ''M. balbisiana''.<ref name=WCSP_Mp/>\n\n[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisica'' include:\n* A large number of subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp. ''sapientum'' <small>(L.) Kuntze</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''dacca'' <small>Horan.</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''sapidisiaca'' <small>K.C.Jacob, nom. superfl.</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''sapientum'' <small>L.</small>, and a large number of its varietal names, including ''M.'' \u00d7 ''sapientum'' var. ''paradisiaca'' <small>(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.</small>\n\nGenerally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system see [[List of banana cultivars]].\n\nIn 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.<ref name=dHon12/>\n\n==Bananas and plantains==\nIn regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]\", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that \"a plantain is not a banana\". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.<ref name=Chiquita/> Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the \"[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18\u201319}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.\n[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]\nAn alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are \"plantains\".<ref name=StovSimm87p183/><ref name=QiMoorOrch00/> Small farmers in [[Colombia]] grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.<ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/>\n\nIn Southeast Asia \u2013 the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated \u2013 the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both [[#Cavendish|Cavendish cultivars]], the classic yellow dessert bananas, and [[Saba banana|Saba cultivars]], used mainly for cooking, are called ''pisang'' in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], ''kluai'' in [[Thailand]] and ''chuoi'' in [[Vietnam]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|pp=8\u201312}} [[Fe'i banana]]s, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.<ref name=Engl03/>\n\nIn summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.\n\n==Historical cultivation==\n\n===Early cultivation===\n{{See also|Musa acuminata}}\n[[File:Banana ancestors (Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana) original range.png|thumb|Original [[Range (biology)|native ranges]] of the ancestors of modern edible bananas.

Recent [[archaeology|archaeological]] and palaeoenvironmental evidence at [[Kuk Swamp]] in the [[Western Highlands Province]] of Papua New Guinea suggests that banana cultivation there goes back to at least 5000 [[Common Era|BCE]], and possibly to 8000 BCE.<ref name=apscience/><ref name=Denh03/> It is likely that other species were later and independently domesticated elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is the region of [[Center of diversity|primary diversity]] of the banana. Areas of secondary diversity are found in [[Africa]], indicating a long history of banana cultivation in the region.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=7}}\n\n[[File:Bananas Muslim world.JPG|thumb|Actual and probable diffusion of bananas during [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Islamic times]] (700\u20131500 CE)<ref name=Wats83/>|alt=Map stating that banana cultivation occurred in pre-Islamic times in India and Southeast Asia, during the 700\u20131500 CE \"Islamic period\" along the [[Nile River]] and in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and less-certainly in sub-Saharan Africa during that same period]]\n[[Phytolith]] discoveries in [[Cameroon]] dating to the first millennium BCE<ref name=Mbid00/> triggered an as yet unresolved debate about the date of first cultivation in Africa. There is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in [[Madagascar]] around that time.<ref name=Zell05/> The earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates to no earlier than late 6th century CE.<ref name=Lejj05/> It is likely, however, that bananas were brought at least to [[Madagascar]] if not to the East African coast during the phase of [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] colonization of the island from South East Asia c. 400 CE.<ref name=Rand09/>\n\nThe banana may also have been present in isolated locations elsewhere in the [[Middle East]] on the eve of [[Islam]]. The [[spread of Islam]] was followed by far-reaching diffusion. There are numerous references to it in Islamic texts (such as poems and [[hadith]]s) beginning in the 9th century. By the 10th century the banana appears in texts from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]]. From there it diffused into North Africa and [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]]. During the medieval ages, bananas from [[Granada]] were considered among the best in the Arab world.<ref name=Wats83/> In 650, Islamic conquerors brought the banana to Palestine. Today, banana consumption increases significantly in Islamic countries during [[Ramadan]], the month of daylight fasting.<ref name=thefinancialexpress-bd/>\n\nBananas were certainly grown in the Christian [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] by the late medieval period. Writing in 1458, the Italian traveller and writer Gabriele Capodilista wrote favourably of the extensive farm produce of the estates at Episkopi, near modern-day [[Limassol]], including the region's banana plantations.<ref name=Jenn92/>\n\nBananas were introduced to the [[Americas]] by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors who brought the fruits from [[West Africa]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Botgard/>\n\nMany [[Musa (genus)#Species|wild banana species]] as well as cultivars exist in extraordinary diversity in [[India]], [[China]], and [[Southeast Asia]].\n{{quote|There are fuzzy [[Musa velutina|bananas whose skins are bubblegum pink]]; green-and-white striped bananas with pulp the color of orange sherbet; bananas that, when cooked, taste like strawberries.

It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed bananas to have more time between harvesting and ripening. North America shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C. Keith|Minor C Keith]] also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's [[Chiquita Brands International]] and [[Dole Food Company|Dole]].<ref name=Koep08/> These companies were monopolistic, [[vertically integrated]] (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term [[Banana republic]] for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the [[Cold War]], to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean===\n{{Main article|History of peasant banana production in the Americas}}\n\nThe vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThere are peasant sector banana growers who produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The [[Windward Islands]] are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1\u20132 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas. This style of cultivation often was popular in the islands as bananas required little labor input and brought welcome extra income.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Banana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nAfter the signing of the [[NAFTA]] agreements in the 1990s, however, the tide turned against peasant producers. Their costs of production were relatively high and the ending of favorable tariff and other supports, especially in the European Economic Community, made it difficult for peasant producers to compete with the bananas grown on large plantations by the well capitalized firms like Chiquita and Dole. Not only did the large companies have access to cheap labor in the areas they worked, but they were better able to afford modern agronomic advances such as fertilization. The \"dollar banana\" produced by these concerns made the profit margins for peasant bananas unsustainable.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nCaribbean countries have sought to redress this problem by providing government supported agronomic services and helping to organize producers' cooperatives. They have also been supporters of the [[Fair Trade]] movement which seeks to balance the inequities in the world trade in commodities.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===East Africa===\n{{Main article|East African Highland bananas}}\nMost farms supply local consumption. Cooking bananas represent a major food source and a major [[income]] source for smallhold farmers. In east Africa, [[East African Highland bananas|highland bananas]] are of greatest importance as a staple food crop. In countries such as [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]], and [[Rwanda]] per capita consumption has been estimated at {{convert|45|kg}} per year, the highest in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Modern cultivation==\nAll widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''. While the original wild bananas contained large seeds, [[diploid]] or [[polyploid]] cultivars (some being [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]) with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption.<ref name=Cast09/> These are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from offshoots. The plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time; a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller \"sucker\" or \"follower\" to produce fruit in 6\u20138 months. The life of a banana plantation is 25 years or longer, during which time the individual stools or planting sites may move slightly from their original positions as lateral [[rhizome]] formation dictates.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nCultivated bananas are [[parthenocarpy|parthenocarpic]], i.e. the flesh of the fruit swells and ripens without its seeds being fertilized and developing. Lacking viable seeds, propagation typically involves farmers removing and transplanting part of the underground stem (called a corm). Usually this is done by carefully removing a sucker (a vertical shoot that develops from the base of the banana pseudostem) with some roots intact. However, small [[sympodial]] corms, representing not yet elongated suckers, are easier to transplant and can be left out of the ground for up to two weeks; they require minimal care and can be shipped in bulk.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIt is not necessary to include the corm or root structure to propagate bananas; severed suckers without root material can be propagated in damp [[sand]], although this takes somewhat longer.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn some countries, commercial propagation occurs by means of [[tissue culture]]. This method is preferred since it ensures disease-free planting material. When using vegetative parts such as suckers for propagation, there is a risk of transmitting diseases (especially the devastating [[Panama disease]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAs a non-seasonal crop, bananas are available fresh year-round.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Cavendish===\n{{main article|Cavendish bananas}}\n[[File:Bananas.jpg|thumb|alt=Grocery store photo of several bunches of bananas|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the main commercial banana cultivars sold in the world market.]]\n\nIn global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploid [[List of banana cultivars#AAA Group|AAA]] [[cultivar group|group]] of ''Musa acuminata'', commonly referred to as Cavendish group bananas. They accounted for the majority of banana exports,<ref name=Cast09/> despite only coming into existence in 1836.<ref name=Homecooking/> The cultivars [[Dwarf Cavendish]] and [[Grand Nain]] (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, [[Gros Michel banana|Gros Michel]] (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to [[Panama disease]], caused by the fungus ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' which attacks the roots of the banana plant.<ref name=Cast09/> Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama Disease but in 2013 there were fears that the [[Black Sigatoka]] fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nEase of transport and shelf life rather than superior taste make the Dwarf Cavendish the main export banana.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nEven though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.<ref name=straightdope/> Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and [[genetic engineering]] programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana.<ref name=Cast09/>\n\n===Ripening===\nExport bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.<ref name=Ding07/><ref name=Ahma11/> Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.\n[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas. The left is in sunlight; the right is under ultraviolet light.]]\n\"Tree-ripened\" Cavendish bananas have a greenish-yellow appearance which changes to a brownish-yellow as they ripen further. Although both flavor and texture of tree-ripened bananas is generally regarded as superior to any type of green-picked fruit,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} this reduces shelf life to only 7\u201310 days.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nBananas can be ordered by the retailer \"ungassed\" (''i.e.'' not treated with ethylene), and may show up at the supermarket fully green. {{lang|es|''[[Guineos verdes]]''}} (green bananas) that have not been gassed will never fully ripen before becoming rotten. Instead of fresh eating, these bananas are best suited to cooking, as seen in Mexican culinary dishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nA 2008 study reported that ripe bananas [[fluoresce]] when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light. This property is attributed to the degradation of [[chlorophyll]] leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit. The chlorophyll [[breakdown product]] is stabilized by a [[propionate]] [[ester]] group. Banana-plant leaves also fluoresce in the same way. Green bananas do not fluoresce. The study suggested that this allows animals which can see light in the ultraviolet spectrum ([[tetrachromat]]s and [[pentachromat]]s) to more easily detect ripened bananas.<ref name=Mose08/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Storage and transport===\nBananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets. To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature. The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3\u20134 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Unripe bananas can not be held in home refrigerators because they suffer from the cold.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.<ref name=ChiquitaRipen/>\n\nCarbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string. This treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to 3\u20134 weeks without the need for refrigeration.<ref name=Scot70/><ref name=Scot71/><ref name=Scot74/>\n\n===Production and export===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1em\"\n|+ Production and export of bananas and plantains by country<ref group=\"Note\" name=Note1/>\n!

Some countries produce statistics which distinguish between bananas and plantains, but two of the top three producers ([[India]] and [[China]]) do not, so comparisons can only be made using the total for bananas and plantains combined. The 2012 statistics (see Table 1) show that India led the world in banana production, producing around 18% of the worldwide crop of 139&nbsp;million metric tonnes. [[Philippines]] was the next largest producer with around 7% of the worldwide crop. Its national data does distinguish between bananas and plantains, and shows that the latter made up over 95% of production. Ten countries produced around two thirds of the total world production.<ref group=\"Note\" name=Note1/>\n\nThe statistics for the export of bananas and plantains show a rather different picture (see Table 2). Total world exports at around 18&nbsp;million metric tonnes amounted to only 12% of total world production; two thirds of the exports were generated by only five countries. The top three producing countries do not appear in this table, and two countries, [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]], do not appear in the table of top producers. Only the Philippines has a consistent position in both tables. Exports were dominated by [[Ecuador]], with 29% of the world total. Statistics for Ecuador distinguish between bananas and plantains; 93% of its exports were classified as bananas.<ref group=\"Note\" name=Note1/>\n\nBananas and plantains constitute a major staple [[agriculture|food crop]] for millions of people in [[developing country|developing countries]]. In most tropical countries, green (unripe) bananas used for [[cooking]] represent the main cultivars. Bananas are cooked in ways that are similar to [[potato]]es. Both can be [[frying|fried]], [[boiling|boiled]], [[baking|baked]], or chipped and have similar [[taste]] and texture when served. One banana provides about the same [[calorie]]s as one potato.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nMost producers are small-scale [[farmer]]s either for home consumption or local markets. Because bananas and plantains produce fruit year-round, they provide an extremely valuable food source during the ''hunger season'' (when the food from one annual/semi-annual harvest has been consumed, and the next is still to come). Bananas and plantains are therefore critical to global [[food security]].\n\nBananas have been an important source of disagreement in the Doha Round of trade talks. A study for [[ICTSD]] showed that the new deal on EU banana import tariffs will be a boon to [[Latin American]] exporters but would trigger a drop in exports of the fruit from African, Caribbean and Pacific ([[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]]) countries.<ref name=Anan09/>\n\nBananas are among the most widely consumed foods in the world. [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]], [[Fresh Del Monte Produce|Del Monte]], [[Dole Food Company|Dole]], and [[Fyffes]] grow their own bananas in Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]]. Banana plantations are capital intensive and demand significant expertise. The majority of independent growers are large and wealthy landowners in these countries. Producers have attempted to raise prices via marketing them as \"[[fair trade]]\" or [[Rainforest Alliance]]-certified in some countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe banana has an extensive trade history starting with firms such as the Irish [[Fyffes]] and the US [[United Fruit Company]] (now Chiquita) at the end of the 19th century. For much of the 20th century, bananas and [[coffee]] dominated the export economies of [[Central America]]. In the 1930s, bananas and [[coffee]] made up as much as 75% of the region's exports. As late as 1960, the two crops accounted for 67% of the exports from the region. Though the two were grown in similar regions, they tended not to be distributed together. The [[United Fruit Company]] based its business almost entirely on the banana trade, because the coffee trade proved too difficult to control. The term \"[[banana republic]]\" has been applied to most countries in [[Central America]], but from a strict economic perspective only Costa Rica, Honduras, and [[Panama]] had economies dominated by the banana trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe [[European Union]] has traditionally imported many of its bananas from former European [[Caribbean]] colonies, paying guaranteed prices above global market rates (see [[Lom\u00e9 Convention]]). These arrangements have now been largely withdrawn under pressure from other major trading powers, principally the [[United States]]. The withdrawal of these indirect subsidies to Caribbean producers is expected to favour the more efficient banana producers of Central America, in which American companies have an economic interest. In addition, small-scale Caribbean producers are finding it difficult to comply with increasingly strict certification requirements. Some support is being provided to Caribbean countries under the EU's Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM).<ref name=Agritrade/>\n\nThe United States produces few bananas. A mere {{convert|14000|t}} were grown in Hawaii in 2001.<ref name=ipmcenters/> Bananas were once grown in [[Florida]] and southern California.<ref name=crfg/>\n\nIn March 2014 it was announced that Fyffes and Chiquita would merge to create the world's largest banana company, worth about $1bn (\u00a3597m). The new firm, named ChiquitaFyffes, is expected to sell about 160 million boxes of bananas annually.<ref name=BBC140310/>\n\n==Pests, diseases, and natural disasters==\n{{Main article|List of banana and plantain diseases}}\n[[File:BananasBlueBagStLucia.jpg|thumb|upright|Banana bunches are sometimes encased in plastic bags for protection. The bags may be coated with [[pesticide]]s.|alt=Photo of bananas in blue plastic bag]]\n\nWhile in no danger of outright extinction, the most common edible banana cultivar Cavendish (extremely popular in Europe and the Americas) could become unviable for large-scale cultivation in the next 10\u201320 years. Its predecessor '[[Gros Michel]]', discovered in the 1820s, suffered this fate. Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.<ref name=NS060613/><ref name=Mont03/> Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a \"typical banana\" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on [[mendelian inheritance|monogenetic]] cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Panama disease===\n[[Panama disease]] is caused by a [[fusarium]] soil [[fungus]] (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing [[gel]]s and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to [[wilting|wilt]], and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on \"Gros Michel\", which was highly susceptible.<ref name=Bark08/> Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality [[fruit]]. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish, and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.{{by whom|date=August 2012}}{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAccording to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish. All plants are genetically identical, which prevents evolution of disease resistance. Researchers are examining hundreds of wild varieties for resistance.<ref name=Bark08/>\n\n====Tropical race 4====\nTropical race 4 (TR4) is a reinvigorated strain of Panama disease first discovered in 1993. This virulent form of fusarium wilt has wiped out Cavendish in several southeast Asian countries. It has yet to reach the Americas; however, soil fungi can easily be carried on boots, clothing, or tools. This is how TR4 travels and is its most likely route into Latin America. Cavendish is highly susceptible to TR4, and over time, Cavendish is almost certain to be eliminated from commercial production by this disease. The only known defense to TR4 is genetic resistance.<ref name=IBS/>\n\n===Black sigatoka===\n[[Black sigatoka]] is a fungal leaf spot disease first observed in [[Fiji]] in 1963 or 1964. Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars<ref name =Holmes/>), impeding [[photosynthesis]] by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow [[ripening|ripen]] prematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment, with the current expense for treating {{convert|1|ha}} exceeding [[United States dollar|$]]1,000 per year. In addition to the expense, there is the question of how long intensive spraying can be environmentally justified. Several resistant cultivars of banana have been developed, but none has yet received commercial acceptance due to taste and texture issues.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n====In East Africa====\nWith the arrival of [[black sigatoka]], banana production in eastern Africa fell by over 40%. For example, during the 1970s, Uganda produced {{convert|15|to|20|t}} of bananas per hectare. Today, production has fallen to only {{convert|6|t}} per hectare.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe situation has started to improve as new disease-resistant cultivars have been developed by the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] and the National Agricultural Research Organisation of Uganda (NARO), such as FHIA-17 (known in [[Uganda]] as the [[Kabana 3]]). These new cultivars taste different from the Cabana banana, which has slowed their acceptance by local farmers. However, by adding [[mulch]] and [[manure]] to the soil around the base of the plant, these new cultivars have substantially increased yields in the areas where they have been tried.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] and NARO, funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research|CGIAR]] have started trials for [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] bananas that are resistant to both Black sigatoka and banana weevils. It is developing cultivars specifically for smallholder and subsistence farmers.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Banana bunchy top virus===\n[[Banana bunchy top virus]] (BBTV) jumps from plant to plant using [[aphid]]s. It stunts leaves, resulting in a \"bunched\" appearance. Generally, an infected plant does not produce fruit, although mild strains exist which allow some production. These mild strains are often mistaken for malnourishment, or a disease other than BBTV. There is no cure; however, its effect can be minimized by planting only [[plant tissue culture|tissue-cultured plants]] (in vitro propagation), controlling aphids, and immediately removing and destroying infected plants.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Banana bacterial wilt===\n\n[[Banana Xanthomonas wilt|Banana bacterial wilt]] (BBW) is a bacterial disease caused by ''[[Xanthomonas campestris]]'' pv. ''musacearum''.<ref name=Tush04/> After being originally identified on a close relative of bananas, ''[[Ensete ventricosum]]'', in [[Ethiopia]] in the 1960s,<ref name=Brad68/> BBW occurred in Uganda in 2001 affecting all banana cultivars.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<ref name=Fahl00/><ref name=Mui02/><ref name=Salm96/>\n\nDuring the [[Ripening|ripening process]], bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a \"starchier\" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.<ref name=plantphys/><ref name=newton/>\n\nBananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves|jam]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular amongst [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] and other travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in [[Asia]] that cater to this group of travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Tur\u00f3n (food)|tur\u00f3n]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana|Saba]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,<ref name=pazhampachadi/> fried into chips (''upperi'')<ref name=Hindu130413/> or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').<ref name=Hindu110228/> [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]].

They are often used as ecologically friendly disposable food containers or as \"plates\" in [[South Asia]] and several [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. In [[Indonesian cuisine]], banana leaf is employed in cooking method called [[pepes]] and [[botok]]; the banana leaf packages containing food ingredients and spices are cooked on steam, in boiled water or grilled on charcoal. In the South Indian states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]] in every occasion the food must be served in a banana leaf and as a part of the food a banana is served. Steamed with dishes they impart a subtle sweet flavor. They often serve as a wrapping for grilling food. The leaves contain the juices, protect food from burning and add a subtle flavor.<ref name=morton/>  In Tamil Nadu (India) leaves are fully dried and used as packing material for food stuffs and also making cups to hold liquid foods. In Central American countries, banana leaves are often used as wrappers for [[tamales]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n====Trunk====\nThe tender core of the banana plant's trunk is also used in [[South Asian]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]], and notably in the [[Burma|Burmese]] dish [[mohinga]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Banana and cross section.jpg|Peeled, whole, and longitudinal section\nFile:Cavendish DS.jpg|A bunch of Cavendish banana\nFile:Bananajf.jpg|''Kilawin na pus\u00f4 ng saging'', a [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Filipino dish]] using banana flowers\nFile:Nacatamales in steamer.jpg|Nicaraguan Nacatamales, in banana leaves, ready to be steamed\nFile:Kaeng yuak.JPG|''Kaeng yuak'' is a northern [[Thai curry]] made with the core of the banana plant\nFile:Pisang goreng in a basket.jpg|''[[Pisang goreng]]'' fried banana coated in batter, popular snack in [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]]\nFile:YosriPengatPisang.jpg|Banana in sweet gravy, known as ''pengat pisang'' in Malay.

In [[Japan]], banana cultivation for clothing and household use dates back to at least the 13th century. In the Japanese system, leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to ensure softness. Harvested shoots are first boiled in [[lye]] to prepare fibers for [[yarn]]-making. These banana shoots produce fibers of varying degrees of softness, yielding yarns and textiles with differing qualities for specific uses. For example, the outermost fibers of the shoots are the coarsest, and are suitable for [[tablecloth]]s, while the softest innermost fibers are desirable for [[kimono]] and [[hakama|kamishimo]]. This traditional Japanese cloth-making process requires many steps, all performed by hand.<ref>{{cite web |title =Traditional Crafts of Japan \u2013 Kijoka Banana Fiber Cloth |publisher=Association for the Promotion of Traditional Craft Industries |url=http://www.kougei.or.jp/english/crafts/0130/f0130.html |accessdate=December 11, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061104231743/http://www.kougei.or.jp/english/crafts/0130/f0130.html|archivedate= November 4, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[Nepal]]ese system the trunk is harvested instead, and small pieces are subjected to a softening process, mechanical fiber extraction, bleaching and drying.
