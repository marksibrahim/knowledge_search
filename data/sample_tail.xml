      <text xml:space="preserve">Parracombe is the name of a Bagueley diesel locomotive that currently resides on the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] in the [[Isle of Man]] in private ownership.  It has not operated in service on the railway since arriving in 2007 from the [[Lynton and Barnstaple Railway]] in [[Devon]], where it had seen service on the [[Lynbarn Railway]] at the Milky Way theme park in [[Clovelly]]. It was built by Baguley (works No. 3232 of 1947) and once worked at [[Butlins]] [[Clacton]] Holiday Camp, from where it featured on the closing credits to the situation comedy [[Hi-De-Hi]] in the 1980s. Currently in store, it performed a very limited number of passenger services as part of an enthusiasts event in July 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Giulio Chazalettes''' (*1930) is an Italian [[opera]] [[director]] and former [[actor]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Verona]]&lt;ref&gt;http://delteatro.it/dizionario_dello_spettacolo_del_900/c/chazalettes.php&lt;/ref&gt; (according to another source in [[Torino]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayerische.staatsoper.de/309-ZG9tPWRvbTMmaWQ9NDIwJmw9ZW4-~popups~k_biographie.html&lt;/ref&gt;). He was taught in music by his mother, a [[German]] pianist. After having settled in [[Milan]], he was accepted by the [[Piccolo Teatro]]'s acting school. Soon he also joined the company, and appeared in ''Sacrilegio massimo'' by [[Stefano Landi]], and replaced [[Giorgio De Lullo]] in [[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]. Later he went to [[Dresden]] to work as an actor and assistant director. Returning to Italy, he finished his musical education at the [[Florence]] conservatory. Chazalettes then started his career as an opera director. In 1976, he debuted at [[La Scala]] with [[Massenet]]'s ''[[Werther]]'' (conducted by [[Georges Prêtre]]). His debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] came in 1980 with [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (conducted by [[Giuseppe Sinopoli]]). Chazalettes also worked for the [[Chicago Lyric Opera]] and the [[Bavarian State Opera]]. In 1989, he directed [[Frederica von Stade]] in Massenet's ''Cherubin'' for the [[Santa Fe Opera]], about which the [[New York Times]] wrote: ''&quot;Giulio Chazalettes's staging adopts a broadly comical, burlesque-opera approach that emphasizes Cherubin's lack of discrimination in woman-chasing. The countess (Melanie Helton) and the baroness (Judith Christin) fluttered about as painted gargoyles, their grotesqueness contrasting sharply with the beauty of the boy's other loves, the dancer L'Ensoleillad (Karen Huffstodt) and the peasant girl Nina (Sheryl Woods). Subtler production styles could be imagined, certainly, but this one often tickled the work hilariously into life.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/04/arts/review-opera-massenet-s-infrequently-performed-cherubin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Young Earth-Scientists for Society (YES) Congress 2009==

===Background:===
The Young Earth-Scientists for Society (YES) Network was formed in 2008. The network is an association of earth-scientists who are primarily under the age of 35 years that represent geological organizations and companies from across the world. In collaboration with the International Year of Planet Earth (IYPE) the YES Network is organizing the [http://www.yescongress2009.org/ first international YES Congress] that will focus on global climate, environmental and geological challenges facing today’s society, as well as career and academic pathway challenges faced by young geoscientists. The conference also aims to establish an interdisciplinary global network of individuals committed to solving these challenges, and furthering the IYPE motto of “Earth Sciences for Society”. 
The conference will be hosted at [http://www.cugb.edu.cn/cugbhomepage.asp China University of Geosciences] in Beijing, China from 25 to 28 October. 


===Format:===
====Oral and Poster Sessions====
The conference will provide poster and oral sessions that will focus around the ten main themes of the IYPE, as well as three additional themes that are unique to the conference: 

'''Oral and Poster Session Themes:'''
# Groundwater –towards sustainable use
# Hazards – minimizing risk, maximizing awareness
# Earth &amp; Health – building a safer environment
# Climate - the “stone tape”
# Resources –” towards sustainable use”
# Megacities – going deeper, building safer
# Deep Earth – from crust to core
# Ocean – abyss of time
# Soils – the living skin of the Earth
# Earth &amp; Life – origins of diversity
# The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift, changes and global changes
# Digital Earth Engineering
# Geoheritage Conversation and Geoparks

====Roundtable Symposia====
The conference will also provide roundtable symposia that aim to foster a prominent conversation between scientists, policy makers and society as a whole. The roundtables will include a series of short presentations by subject matter experts, a panel discussion and then working group sessions in which roundtable participants will work together to propose actions and tasks for the Y.E.S. Network to address in solving the issues raised by the roundtable session presentations and discussions. The roundtables will engage both senior and young geoscientists as both presenters and participants. Roundtables session deal with two main topics:  scientific challenges of our generation and academic and career pathway challenges for young geoscientists. 


'''Roundtable Symposia Themes: '''
* Climate Change in the Polar Regions 
* Natural Resources and Energy Sustainability 
* Natural Hazards 

* Transfer of Credentials / International Licensure 
* Issues Facing Global Geoscience Education and Research
* Women in the Geoscience Workforce
* Industry-Academic Linkages: Connecting the needs of the workforce with the tools of the classroom 

* Synthesis &amp; Strategy - Summary of Roundtable Sessions

      <text xml:space="preserve">Super Sailor Moon is Usagi Tuskino's second [[Sailor Moon]] form. Her Sailor Fuku almost completely changes than Sailor Moon's fuku. Her collar is still dark blue with two (three in the manga) yellow stripes. Her belt has a yellow belt on top, and her back bow was coloured lilac, enlarged and extended. Her skirt was white, with a thick blue stripe around the bottom edge, and a yellow thick stripe on top of the blue one. She had wing-like barrettes in front of her [[odango]] covers. Her choker is yellow with a red heart motif. In this form, her attacks are Rainbow Moon Heart Ache and her new attack, using the Kalaidemoon Scope, Moon Gorgeous Meditation.

She transforms in sync with [[Chibiusa]], who transforms into Super Sailor Chibi Moon. This form of Sailor Moon is shown until [[Sailor Moon Sailor Stars]], when she transforms into her next form, Eternal Sailor Moon.</text>

== '''Dois I. Rosser Jr.''' ==

Dois Rosser has a longtime career as a businessman in Hampton Roads birthed multiple auto dealerships, land development projects and numerous business ventures.  As he will quickly say, “all of my life in the business world was preparation for what God has for me now.”  As Dois sat at the feet of Pastor Dick Woodward in the late seventies, hearing Dick’s fresh approach to the scriptures, he became burdened to get the Word into the world.  He embarked on a project recording Pastor Woodward’s [http://www.minibiblecollege.org/ Mini Bible College].  This message was first broadcast in America, then throughout Central and South America, and is now translated in 26 languages spoken by over 4 billion people.  During a trip to India in 1986, Dois saw the immense need for providing solid places of worship for congregations whereby they could be nurtured in their faith.  This led him to build ICM’s first two churches.  Since then, over 2,900 churches are built or under construction in 48 countries throughout the world.

Dois currently serves as the chair emeritus and founder of [http://www.icm.org/ International Cooperating Ministries].  He previously served on the board of Trans World Radio, the Lausanne Conference for World Evangelism, and Leighton Ford Ministries, Youth Focus, Overseas Council for Theological &amp; Missions, Inc., and Prison Fellowship Ministries.  Time magazine awarded him its Virginia Quality Dealer Award in 2000; in 1989 he was elected Layman of the Year by the Religious Heritage of America.  In 1988 he received a National Brotherhood and Sisterhood citation from the National Conference of Christians and Jews.  In 1986 he was presented the Unsung Virginia award for his quiet contributions to his home community.  Dois was educated at the Walton School of Commerce in Chicago.  He lives in Hampton, Virginia, and has been married to the former Shirley Sutton since 1943.  They have three daughters, 2 sons in law and eight grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.</text>

This [[WP:BLP|BLP]] fails [[WP:BIO]]. His large format photographic prints are heavily marketed at a few retail shops in the US but there is little or no independent, non-sales-driven critical or in-depth commentary on this photographer. There is a long, uncited list of awards which don't seem to be [[WP:V|verifiable]]. Given these worries, article is also mostly an unencyclopedic [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]].

'''N-SAT-110''', also known as '''JCSAT-110''', '''Superbird-5''' and '''Superbird-D''', is a [[Japan]]ese geostationary [[communications satellite]] which is jointly operated by [[JSAT Corporation]] and [[Space Communications Corporation]]. It is positioned in [[geostationary orbit]] at a [[longitude]] of 110° East, from where it is used to provide communications services to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptvjsat.com/en/business/satellite/list/n_sat_110.html|title=N-SAT-110|publisher=Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_nsat_110.html|title=NSat 110|publisher=TSE|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

N-SAT-110 was built by [[Lockheed Martin]], and is based around the [[A2100AX]] [[satellite bus]]. It is equipped with 24 J band (IEEE Ku band) [[transponder]]s, and at launch it had a mass of {{convert|3531|kg}}, with an expected operational lifespan of around 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html|title=UCS Satellite Database|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/index_frame.htm?http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/nsat-110.htm|title=N-SAT 110 (JCSat 110, Superbird 5 (D))|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of N-SAT-110 was conducted by [[Arianespace]], using a [[Ariane 4|Ariane 44L]] carrier rocket flying from [[ELA-2]] at the [[Guiana Space Centre]]. The launch occurred at 23:00 GMT on 6 October 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;JSR-LL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully deployed N-SAT-110 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]], from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit by means of an onboard [[LEROS-1C]] apogee motor. Its insertion into geosynchronous orbit occurred at 03:00 on 14 October 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSOHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/geo.date|title=Index|work=Geostationary Orbit Catalog|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment''', ''ASLE India'', is envisioned as forum for the collective and intellectual pursuit of the human-nature nexus. Although the academic pursuit of the space that the human being inhabits—coterminous with the natural world—its intricacies and complexities have come to be interrogated in the academic circles in India (especially in the University circles) fairly recently after the historical evolution of ecological criticism (ecocriticism for short) in the  Anglo-American literary and theoretical spheres, the roots and ideas of this fast-enlarging field of inquiry extends deep into Indian cultural and aesthetic history as well. Be its revelation through the much-critiqued Vedic and Upanishadic verses couched in the Sanskrit idiom, or its manifestations through the variety of regional writing practiced variously over this rich and antique land, the diverse array of Indian art and its practice, ecology and environmental wisdom has been the natural heritage of this part of the world. ASLE India works towards a resuscitation of this vision—not through mere rehashing and reiterating but through a self-conscious inheritance, a deliberate recognition of history and culture. ASLE India attempts to interrogate even the very foundation and theoretical underpinnings of this disciplinary inquiry. It is open to the interventions of like-minded and serious scholars and intellectuals. The official Website of ASLE India is www.asleindia.webs.com

== Origin ==
[http://www.asleindia.webs.com/ ASLE India] was conceived on 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; January 2005 as a significant date- The first day of the Tamil New Year (the commencement of the harvest festival). it began with the meeting of a few scholars equally committed to nature and human nature. Its beginning marked the recognition of unity and diversity of universality and difference.

Polar Bear is a battery electric locomotive built by [[Alan Keef]] in [[2003]] for the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] in the [[Isle of Man]], where it currently resides.  It was built on the frame of a 1988-built vehicle of similar design (one of the last to be built) and has a newly-fabricated body replicating that of two similar locomotives that operated the railway between 1921 and 1926.  The original was built by [[Wingrove &amp; Rogers]] in [[1920]], and allocated works no. 314 and the operating replica is in original form.  However, the 1920 version proved troublesome and within the first season had been modified to include bogies to reduce the uncomfortable ride.  Further modification came with the addition of a battery truck that the loco pushed around, though the replica does not carry these later features.

The 60-game tournament will feature a third-place playoff between the losing semi-finalists as a qualifier for the Champions League and could also see the induction of ICL players. The IPL governing council, which met in Mumbai on Tuesday, has also decided to include two new teams from the fourth edition in 2011.

Nagpur, Visakhapatnam, Ahmedabad and Dharamsala are the new venues, hosting some games of the Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, respectively. Hyderabad will stage the opening fixture between defending champions Deccan Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders, while both semi-finals will be held in Bangalore. The venue of the final hasn't been fixed but the season will end five days before the World Twenty20 opens in West Indies.

Today's decisions brought good news for the former ICL players, though their participation is subject to the BCCI's formal approval. They will now join the gravy train, though their payout could be considerably less than many of their peers. They will be valued in two categories; Indian domestic players will be paid Rs 8-20 lakh ($18,000-45,000) while international players, both Indian and foreign, will be made available through auction.

The IPL will also make use of the services of the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) for the third season. The BCCI had agreed to draft in ACSU for the upcoming Champions League in October as well, at the ICC board's annual conference in London last month.

Another development for the new season was the reduction in the 'strategic timeout' from seven-and-a-half minutes to five. The timeout - which will be mandatory for both sides - will be split into two breaks of equal length with the bowling team opting for it between overs 6-10, and the batting team allowed to choose between overs 11-16.

At his press conference following the meeting, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi also outlined plans for Season 4 onwards. Two franchises will be added to the league, through an auction to be held next January, and the tournament will expand from 60 games to 94. The player auction for the fourth season, with a new salary cap, will be held in the summer of 2010 to allow squads to integrate. The 'icon player' concept will be done away with but there will be no change in the number of international players - ten in the squad and four on the field.

The second season was held in South Africa in April-May this year after the Indian government declined to provide security because the tournament overlapped with general elections in the country.</text>

The '''1930-31 [[Rugby Football League]] season''' was the thirty first season of [[Rugby league|rugby league football]].

==Season summary==

Swinton won their third Championship when they defeated Leeds 14-7 in the play-off final.  They had also finished the regular season as league leaders.

The Challenge Cup Winners were Halifax who beat York 22-8.

The format of the competition was changed so that all clubs played the same number of matches, and percentages were done away with. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=350|title=1930-31 Season summary|accessdate=2009-08-08|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is closely related to the other natural sciences and, in a sense, encompasses them. Chemistry, for example, deals with the interaction of atoms to form molecules; much of modern geology is largely a study of the physics of the earth and is known as geophysics; and astronomy deals with the physics of the stars and outer space. Even living systems are made up of fundamental particles and, as studied in biophysics and biochemistry, they follow the same types of laws as the simpler particles traditionally studied by a physicist.

The emphasis on the interaction between particles in modern physics, known as the microscopic approach, must often be supplemented by a macroscopic approach that deals with larger elements or systems of particles. This macroscopic approach is indispensable to the application of physics to much of modern technology. Thermodynamics, for example, a branch of physics developed during the 19th century, deals with the elucidation and measurement of properties of a system as a whole and remains useful in other fields of physics; it also forms the basis of much of chemical and mechanical engineering. Such properties as the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas have no meaning for an individual atom or molecule; these thermodynamic concepts can only be applied directly to a very large system of such particles. A bridge exists, however, between the microscopic and macroscopic approach; another branch of physics, known as statistical mechanics, indicates how pressure and temperature can be related to the motion of atoms and molecules on a statistical basis (see Statistics).Physics emerged as a separate science only in the early 19th century; until that time a physicist was often also a mathematician, philosopher, chemist, biologist, engineer, or even primarily a political leader or artist. Today the field has grown to such an extent that with few exceptions modern physicists have to limit their attention to one or two branches of the science. Once the fundamental aspects of a new field are discovered and understood, they become the domain of engineers and other applied scientists. The 19th-century discoveries in electricity and magnetism, for example, are now the province of electrical and communication engineers; the properties of matter discovered at the beginning of the 20th century have been applied in electronics; and the discoveries of nuclear physics, most of them not yet 40 years old, have passed into the hands of nuclear engineers for applications to peaceful or military uses.</text>

A privately owned Uk and European transport and removal firm, specialised in small removals and light haulage, created in England in 2007 by a French expatriate, Remi Girardin, who has been working in Transport in both France and England since 1993&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgts.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;.

With 5 vans, from 10 to 20 m3, they are assuring regular routes between France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Germany, and the Netherland; mainly for private individuals (motorbikes, furniture, lugage, boxes, bags,...) and also in cooperation with European businesses.

RGTS is also working in cooperation with French, English and Spanish universities, offering work placements to students in international business programs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bem.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hull.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urjc.es/&lt;/ref&gt;.

The company has been rapidly growing over the last two years, thanks to an exellent reputation and dedicated staff now composed of 4 drivers, 3 English employees and 2 French interns.

Furthermore, they recently moved into new premises in Taunton, Somerset, owned in cooperation with '''The wright removal company'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewrightremovalcompany.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;, and composed of a large warehouse and brand new offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yell.com/b/R.G.T.S-Removals+_+Overseas-Taunton-TA27DN-4920215/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''René Abjean''' (born 1937) is a French composer associated with [[Breton]] revivalist choral music.

==Life==
Born in Brest, René Abjean made his début as a musician in the choir of [[Plouguerneau]] in 1953. At 17 he created his first vocal work, as part of a choral group that was a cprecursor of the Bretob revivalism of Ar Baganiz and An Triskell, for whom he made many arrangements. He co-founded the Cercle Breton de Brest, and organised the ''Festival International des Cornemuses'' at Brest from 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Becker, Laure Le Gurun, &quot;La musique bretonne&quot;, Coop Breizh, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 


In 1974, il published a monograph on Breton music, wrote for several journals and contributed the chapter on Breton music in ''L’Histoire littéraire et culturelle de la Bretagne''. In 1975 he took over the leadership of the Ploudalmézeau choir , and in 1977 of that at Folgoët. These were later reconstituted as the &quot;Ensemble Choral du Bout du Monde&quot;, which he led until he passed it to Jo Le Gad in 1988.

In 1977, with Pierre-Yves Moign, he founded &quot;le Centre Breton d’Art Populaire&quot; in Brest, over which he presided from 1979 to 1981; he was also associated with the creation of Radio Bretagne Ouest (Radio Breizh Izel). He was a member of the New York Academy of Science from 1997 to 1999. He was decorated with the [[Order of the Ermine]]. He is married to Marie Kermarec.

==Compositions==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Four new venues have been introduced for the third edition of the IPL, which will run from March 12 to April 25 next year. The 60-game tournament will feature a third-place playoff between the losing semi-finalists as a qualifier for the Champions League and could also see the induction of ICL players. The IPL governing council, which met in Mumbai on Tuesday, has also decided to include two new teams from the fourth edition in 2011.

Nagpur, Visakhapatnam, Ahmedabad and Dharamsala are the new venues, hosting some games of the Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, respectively. Hyderabad will stage the opening fixture between defending champions Deccan Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders, while both semi-finals will be held in Bangalore. The venue of the final hasn't been fixed but the season will end five days before the World Twenty20 opens in West Indies.

The decisions brought good news for the former ICL players, though their participation is subject to the BCCI's formal approval. They will now join the gravy train, though their payout could be considerably less than many of their peers. They will be valued in two categories; Indian domestic players will be paid Rs 8-20 lakh ($18,000-45,000) while international players, both Indian and foreign, will be made available through auction.

The IPL will also make use of the services of the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) for the third season. The BCCI had agreed to draft in ACSU for the upcoming Champions League in October as well, at the ICC board's annual conference in London last month.

Another development for the new season was the reduction in the 'strategic timeout' from seven-and-a-half minutes to five. The timeout - which will be mandatory for both sides - will be split into two breaks of equal length with the bowling team opting for it between overs 6-10, and the batting team allowed to choose between overs 11-16.

At his press conference following the meeting, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi also outlined plans for Season 4 onwards. Two franchises will be added to the league, through an auction to be held next January, and the tournament will expand from 60 games to 94. The player auction for the fourth season, with a new salary cap, will be held in the summer of 2010 to allow squads to integrate. The 'icon player' concept will be done away with but there will be no change in the number of international players - ten in the squad and four on the field.

The second season was held in South Africa in April-May this year after the Indian government declined to provide security because the tournament overlapped with general elections in the country.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Equality Trust ==


The [http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/ Equality Trust] is an organisation that attempts to gain the widest public and political understanding of the harm caused by inequality.  Compelling new evidence shows that large income inequalities within societies damage the social fabric and quality of life for everyone.

This evidence is documented in a book written in 2009 by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilkinson_(public_health) Richard Wilkinson]] and Kate Pickett entitled the [http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846140396,00.html Spirit Level].  Based on thirty years of research it provides evidence on each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage births, and child well-being, showing for all eleven of these health and social problems, outcomes are very substantially worse in more unequal societies. 

The relationships have been verified, wherever possible, in two independent test beds: internationally among the rich countries, and then again among the 50 states of the USA. In almost every case it is found that the same tendency for outcomes to be much worse in more unequal societies in both the international and domestic USA settings. 

Evidence is presented on four other important issues. One is how achieving greater equality within the rich countries may contribute to tackling the inequalities between rich and poor countries. Another is a discussion of both the compatibility and relative merits of greater equality and economic growth as sources of improvements in the quality of life among rich countries. There is a page discussing how greater equality may contribute to policies designed to tackle global warming, and lastly, a page ([http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/why/remedies The Remedies]) pointing out that there are many different ways of increasing equality in our societies.
 
The data used comes from the most respected international sources including:

•	The World Bank
•	The World Health Organisation
•	The United Nations
•	UNICEF
•	The US Census Bureau

Much of this work has already been published in peer reviewed academic journals, and some of the relationships have been tested many times by different research groups using data for different societies. Details of the data and statistical techniques that are used are available on the [http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/why/evidence/methods Statistical Sources and Methods] page. The Equality Trust argues that in order to gain substantial improvements in the real quality of life of the populations of developed countries it is necessary that differences in income and wealth are greatly reduced.

The evidence suggests that this will improve health, dramatically reduce the incidence of violence and a wide range of other social problems, improve the quality of social relations for the vast majority of the population, and make the task of developing sustainable economic systems very much easier. 

However, the Trust believes that differences in income and wealth will only be reduced when there is a widespread public understanding of the benefits which greater equality can bring to everybody.  A program of public education is essential to generate the necessary political will among the electorate and politicians alike. 

The Equality Trust has been set up to fulfil that function. Their main task is to broaden and deepen people's understanding, change public attitudes and the climate of opinion, in order to bring more egalitarian pressures to bear on decision making in public and private institutions at all levels from the international to the local. 

In essence, The Equality Trust seeks to:

•	Promote employee-owned organisations and businesses;
•	Liaise with ethical investments funds to promote equality employers;
•	Commission research on equality issues;
•	Publish material relating to equality issues;
•	Lobby politicians and policy-makers at all levels;
•	Engage with all forms of the media to promote the equality message;
•	Give prizes at their Annual Conference for the best equality initiatives.</text>

just north of [[Roxy Ann Peak]]. The lake is formed by the {{convert|86|ft|adj=on}} tall Agate Dam, which impounds Dry Creek, in the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]].

==History==
Construction of Agate Dam was authorized in 1962, started in 1965, and completed in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;&gt;
  {{cite web

The {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} tall earthfill [[embankment dam]] was completed by the Talent Division of the [[Rogue River Basin Project]], impounding Dry Creek. Two [[canal]]s were also built, diverting water from nearby Antelope Creek and [[Little Butte Creek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt; A [[boat ramp]], four [[pit toilet]]s, a [[picnic]] area, and a [[parking lot]] were also built. All but the boat ramp and parking lot have been removed due to excessive [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

==Statistics==
[[Image:Agate Lake Map.png|thumb|right|A map of Agate Lake]]
Agate Lake receives approximately {{convert|23|in|mm}} of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] annually. [[Temperature]]s average from highs of {{convert|89|F|C}} in the [[summer]] to lows of {{convert|22|F|C}} in the [[winter]]. The average [[wind speed]] in the area is {{convert|10|to|15|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

Agate Lake has an average surface area of {{convert|216|acre|km2}}, and an average volume of {{convert|4782|acre.ft|m3}}. It is located {{convert|1510|ft|m}} above sea level, although the water level fluctuates as much as {{convert|25|ft|m}} throughout the year. It has approximately {{convert|3|mi|km}} of [[shore]]line. The [[spillway]] has a capacity of {{convert|3300|ft3/s|m3/s}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

Agate Dam is {{convert|86|ft|m}} tall, {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|3800|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

==Flora and Fauna==
Dry Creek was [[Stream#Intermittent and ephemeral streams|intermittent]] prior to the construction of Agate Dam, and did not have any significant [[fish]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt;

==Recreation==
Non motorized [[boat]]s are allowed on the Agate Lake. [[Swimming]] and [[picnic]]king are also popular activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBP&quot;/&gt;

The Jackson County Parks Department estimates that approximately 5,000 people visit the lake annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- Do not use the &quot;dated prod&quot; template directly; the above line is generated by &quot;subst:prod|reason&quot; --&gt;
== Thesis ==

The general fountainheads of economic success continue to trouble many aspects of the economy as a whole, among them being fuel prices, credit liquidity, consumer confidence, and unemployment. The transportation industry is by no means secluded from this recessionary cycle and in fact can be used as a harbinger itself; when no goods are demanded, high inventories remain stocked and dismiss the necessity for much transport.  Growth is expected to be recuperative as the global market in its entirety pulls itself from shambles. Although, not an economic boon scenario, year-to-year growth rates will be steady and indicative of a growth cycle. A caveat to this is that growth should not imply expansion of the industry, but instead a ‘convergence to the mean’; a boom-and-bust economy holds periods of irrational decline and inflation, yet also briefly sustain periods of normalcy, it is expected that 2010 will be a return to normal market behavior.


== GDP ==

	GDP, interestingly, often mimics freight traffic levels; as it is a measurement of both the economy and the growth of that economy. Historically, US GDP consistently grows each year, however near the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, GDP fell and, some might say, dramatically. During this period, GDP shrank 6% , a decline attributed to the compounding nature from the negative contributions from exports, and other declining investments, however imports, which subtract from the calculation, also decreased, mitigating the deterioration.   GDP is forecasted to reach a value of 14,139 [UNITS] by early 2010; this is a level comparable to early ’09, but still 13% short of mid ’08. What this indicates is a smoothing out of the GDP’s volatility and demonstrates the beginning of a rebound.  


== Index of Consumer Confidence ==

The index of Consumer Confidence is often used to predict future consumer spending and is drawn from a survey of 5,000 U.S. households. In mid-2009 the index was placed at 49.3 points, one of the higher levels in a year, but when looked on a larger scale another story is revealed. Mid-2007 index levels more than twice 2009 levels, hovering around 110 points. This implies that although mid-2009 is not as weak as before, it is still quite weak; it is estimated that a full recovery to mid-2007 levels won’t be existent until mid to late 2010.  


== Consumer Pricing Index ==

	The shipment of goods and products is inherently dependent upon those that want to consume the goods. The CPI can be used as an indicator to determine the underlying demand that fuel the logistical systems in this country, as well as the economy as a whole since consumer spending accounts for 70% of the US economy. The CPI right is rising slowly, yet using historical indicators one can assume the rise will be positive, but hovering around 1-2 % levels . As consumers’ nerves begin to calm from the financial shake-down and stock volatilities settle, one can assume economic reconciliatory patterns will emerge. This pattern will occur simultaneously at the top and bottom with executives rehiring and ramping up production and proletariat consumer will use their new-found discretionary funds to purchase goods, further emboldening the economy.



== Retail Sales ==

	Strong sales are often the pull from demand that creates air in the sails of the supply chain; retail sales tracking is one way to measure this. Although, it should be noted this is often more of a confirmation of recovery than it is an indicator, as there is a lag time in consumer response to economic events. Mid-2009 retail sales levels are on par with the levels seen in the previous six months, which, in the very least, is a sign of mitigating decline. Yet, when compared on a larger level, once again a different picture is painted; mid-2009 float around $340 billion in revenue, while a year early sales were around $375 billion, a disparity of more than 9% for all retail sales. 
	

== Manufacturing ==

	Manufacturing clearly has an impact on the transportation industry by creating goods or materials that need to be shipped. Manufacturing as a whole is seeing less demand than in previous years. Some, more cyclical industries, may have planned for this by creating backlog for harder times, yet non-cyclical firms would have a harder time doing this. Regardless of planning, however, the demand has not been there. Yet as a recovery takes place the sector is expected to rise consistently each month, emerging from the $.3 billion recent downturn. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is a compilation of data taken from a survey of several hundred US manufacturers and acts as an indicator of “on-the-ground” and near to mid-term expectations. An indication of growth would be a PMI above 50, contraction below 50 and any measure above 41.2 implies overall economic expansion. The PMI for the recent recession bottomed out at 32.9 in December ’08 and rose consecutively each month through ’09 to levels in between general economic expansion and the minimum for manufacturing-specific growth. PMI is expected to continue and quicken in pace to expansive levels. 


== Manufacturing Inventories and Sales ==

In an effort to pursue the most efficient and cost-saving structure, businesses will often attempt to maintain close levels of inventory with expected sales. However, as an unexpected economic crisis occurs, stock is less liquid as sales simultaneously diminish, creating a wide and often displeasing disparity between inventory and sales levels. This is represented in the comparison between the 2008 and 2009 sale/ inventory correlation. In mid-2008 inventory was 122% greater than sales, which appears consistent with usual proportions, but by mid-2009 the relationship had grown to 146%.  The illiquidity of the products turns this asset, which one has a future expected earning capabilities to a toxic liability that costs the owner money without delivering any ROI. 


== Index of Industrial Production ==

It is as important to examine the flow of raw material, in the transportation sector, as it is to look at the movement of goods and products; The Index of Industrial Production is a good proxy to review the exchanges from factories, mines, and electric utilities. The index displays a consistent month-to-month decline; in fact at the time of this report seventeen out of the last eighteen months had been negative and had seen a total Industrial Production decline of as much as -13.6%. However, the contracting are slowing each month as well; indicating the emergence out of a trough and, possibly, a recovery cycle. The upward momentum out of the red is inclining at a very fast pace with a ratio of 2/1.


== Capacity Utilization ==

As a symbol of overall slack in the economy with a specific focus on the industrial industries the capacity utilization among manufacturing, mining and utilities is a strong indicator. This index refers to the relationship between actual output that 'is' produced with the installed equipment and the potential output which 'could' be produced with it, if capacity was fully used. In theory, the higher the capacity utilization the less room there is to increase production w/out having to build a new plant or obtain new equipment; indicating strong economic output. 2009 represented a new all-time record low for this sixty-plus year old index, with a string of monthly lows preceding it, dropping from a historical level safely near 80%. As a caveat to these despairing records, is the recognition of a beginning of stabilization near 62% capacity utilization where it will, presumably, bottom-out and begin ascension towards regular levels.

== 
Port Security Grants (as an indication of growth) ==

	One might be able to use the number, and monetary value, of Port Security Grants issued by the Department of Homeland Security each fiscal year as an indication of the transportation’s industry expansion (or for that matter, contraction). As a reference point, seven grants were issued in 2006, three grants worth $567 million and two supplemental packets worth $260 million in 2007 and two grants worth $35 million in 2008.  However, because of slowed global transportation, this number dropped to zero in 2009. Making note of this decline, more than $150 million in stimulus funding was appropriated to the Port Security Grant issuing organization, FEMA’s Grant Programs Directorate. This additional funding has the intention of increasing management capabilities of port-wide infrastructure and provide immediate relief to communities impacted by unemployment and poverty. 
	

== Trucking   ==
                
----
       


== Oil Prices ==

	Debatably, the highest variable cost in the transportation industry is the cost of fuel. Oil prices have been volatile in recent memory, dropping down to US$34/barrel (of West Texas Intermediate, ‘WTI’, crude oil) in February ‘09 from ‘08 peak of US$145/barrel of WTI in July of the previous year. According to Energy Information Administration, an organization that offer official energy statistics from the U.S. government, has released data indicating a relatively stable projected price for WTI. 2009 prices are expected to average out around $70/ barrel of WTI, which will set the ending average $18 above the beginning average, indicating a convergence to normalized prices. 2010 is expected to bring prices further upward, albeit slightly, to an estimated average of $72/barrel of WTI; it interesting to note that this estimated price is very close to an averaging of  inflation-adjusted WTI barrel prices for the years from 2006 up-to 2010; statistically signifying a convergence to the mean. This is significant to notice, since, as a whole, 2010 will, presumably, be a crawl to normalcy from 2008’s exaggerated market state to 2009’s plummeting economy.


== For-Hire Truck Tonnage Index ==

	The trends in the FHTT index’s fluctuations imply a rebound, albeit a very slow and modest one. Tonnage levels have been dancing back and forth, although leaning forward, out of the year-to-year hole the recession produced for the industry. The industry is more leveling out than it is moving upward with tonnage levels expected to remain at current levels for the foreseeable future; probably caused by high levels of inventory still available in the supply chain. The current levels of inventory will continue to stall truck tonnage levels, but it unlikely to deteriorate any further due to modest growth. 

== Long-Distance Shipping ==

----


'''Intermodal'''
Intermodal rail volume is still expected to be in a declining state, but declining at diminishing levels each week, until the industry breaks free from just ‘turning around’. The levels of intermodal traffic from June 2009 (a historically average season) rested just below 190,000 intermodal units; compared to 230,000 units a mere year earlier.   

'''Rail'''
	The most recent data suggest that rail traffic across North America is poised to rebound and expected to enter a growth cycle out of a depressed state of decline that saw levels twenty-five percent lower than in previous years. Because the rail industry is a cyclical industry and thus greatly exposed to economic fluctuations and commodity price volatility, the overall industry is going to be greatly depressed to a severe degree. An example of this steep decline is represented in the Class I Railroad Employment numbers, where employment is a function of the level of business; i.e. how much freight is being hauled? Recent levels of employment fully represent an industry in a trough. In a three-year span rail road employees have fallen by more than 17,000 people, with a steep drop in late ’08, early ’09.  Considering all variables, however, US rail traffic is expected to begin emerging from 2009’s abyss, where rail volume was suppressed as low as 430,000 carload and intermodal units; whereas at this period in the four previous years, volume hadn’t been below 550,000 units. The rise, however, will undoubtedly be slow and by no means represent true industry growth.    
	
'''Railroad Cost Indices'''
The cost of shipping a product by rail decreased from 2008 to 2009 and is estimated to remain cheap through 2010. One of the more costly inputs, fuel, also fell by the highest percentage margin, a whopping 56.3%; other inputs such as materials/ supplies and wage/ fringe benefits rose slightly, but on par with usual rates. 



== Air Cargo ==


Air freight is a unique sector of the transportation industry, in the sense that its service is focused on the speed and distance of product delivery, not cost or bulk; because of this, airfreight has high operating costs, which can cause a dilemma in the face of economic turmoil. Overall the industry is delicate from recessionary effects, despite the sector’s relatively stable demand; additionally high-levels of inventory are diminishing any form of growth. If 2009’s pace continues through 2010, it will take several years to return to early 2008 levels. 


== Ocean Freight ==


'''Container Industry'''
Freight prices have dropped as shippers compete for a declining number of contracts and new vessels ordered during the boom period enter the market, effectively increasing global container-market capacity by 10%. Rates will be near 1990 levels, Kolding said, pushing operating margins to “record lows.” The container industry, as a whole, is estimated to contract 9-10% in 2010. An even more atrocious number contextually, with volume already dropping 24% the prior year. Industry leader, Maersk, has said that the balance between supply and demand won’t be enough to make a satisfactory profit until 2015.  
The HARPEX Index , which measures all good transported by container, will presumably bottom out as the overall global economy begins to recover. However, at the time of this report there has been a continual downslide in the index to never before seen levels in the indices’ 20-plus year history. Alternatively, the Baltic Dry Index , which measures “the demand for shipping capacity in relation to supply of dry bulk [commodities]” has had been showing clear signs of reaching a bottoming out point and perhaps will spearhead the climb towards solvency. 

In summation, when one examines data from the myriad of variables affecting the transportation industry, the sectors within that industry, and the economy as a whole, one can draw a fairly confident conclusion on the industry’s trend; convergence to the mean. 2010 will, undoubtedly, be a year of growth, but not expansion, where the economic indicators rise, but don’t signify development.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Michael Howard Studios''' is an [[acting studio]] for the [[performing arts]] located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]]; the studio was founded in 1953 by actor/director Michael Howard.

==History==
A protégé of both Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse and Lee Strasburg at the Actor’s Studio, Howard established his Studio in 1953 grounded in the work of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]].  Over the years, the studio incorporated many schools of thought and techniques from around the world.

The Studio attributes its existence to the [[Group Theatre]]. In 1931, Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasburg founded the [[Group Theatre]] in New York, beginning a watershed period in American Theater. The Group Theatre brought together [[Elia Kazan]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Sanford Meisner]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Irwin Shaw]], and [[John Garfield]] (among many others). Their creative commune introduced America to the revolutionary teachings of Stanislavski, and it set in motion new schools of thought that would dominate acting for the rest of the century. The Group Theatre closed its doors in 1941, and its visionary members set out in new directions. 

In 1942, [[Michael Howard (actor/teacher)]] joined the Neighborhood Playhouse as a scholarship student under [[Sanford Meisner]]. Howard vigorously pursued his studies and absorbed everything Meisner had to impart. Howard then served in World War II, and upon returning, joined Equity in 1947. [[Lee Strasburg]] invited Howard to study with him, and soon he was asked to become a member of the [[Actor’s Studio]]. Howard began a long career of hundreds of roles on stage and screen, including Odets’ “[[The Country Girl]]” on Broadway and the film “[[The Men]]” with Marlon Brando. Acting led to directing and, in 1952, to teaching, when [[Sidney Lumet]] asked Howard to replace him at the [[High School of Performing Arts]]. The next year, in 1953, a group of actors asked Howard to lead their sessions, and Michael Howard Studios was born.

Over the next five decades, Howard’s teachings expanded to the Yale School of Drama, the Julliard School, the American Conservatory Theatre, and Boston University while continuing his master classes at the Michael Howard Studios. 

The studio is now in it's 55th year in continuous operation making it the longest running private acting studio in New York.
In honor of the 55th anniversary of the studio, the studio received an official proclamation from Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] , declaring May 4, 2009 Michael Howard Studios Day &quot;in honor of the studio's contribution  to New York’s rich theatrical history&quot;.

'''Hospitality Law''' is the body of law relating to the foodservice, travel, and lodging industries.  That is, it is the body of law governing the specific nuances of [[hotels]], [[restaurants]], bars, spas, [[country clubs]], [[meeting and convention planners]], and more.  

Hospitality law doesn’t just involve one area of law.  It encompasses a wide variety of practice areas, including [[contracts]],[[ antitrust]], [[tort law]], and more.  

Recent events have made hospitality law even more relevant.  [[Food allergies]] are on the rise, making it increasingly important for restaurants to not only train staff about ingredients but to also have appropriate labels for food containing peanuts or wheat.  The [[Mumbai terrorist attacks]], which included a hostage situation at the Taj Mahal Hotel among other places, raise questions about what a hotel can legally do to ensure the safety of its guests.  

==Overview==
While hospitality law covers many different entities, hotels and restaurants are the two most common hospitality businesses.  

===Hotels===

Hotel operators in the United States have a duty to their guests and to their guests’ property.  

====Duty to Guest====

Lodging operators have a duty of care to their guests.  This duty does not insure the guests’ safety, but does require the operator to “act prudently and use reasonable care.”&lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009).  Hospitality Law.  p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; This means, among other things, that an operator can be held [[liable]] if he or she is found [[negligent]].  

An operator also must ensure that all of the guests’ personal information is retained and destroyed according to proper and recommended procedure.  

====Duty to Guest Property====

[[Common law]] held innkeepers liable for any loss of guest property when the guest was on their property.  Nearly all states have abrogated that duty, placing limits on an innkeeper’s liability, as long as the innkeeper complies with certain requirements.  These requirements, usually regulated in the state’s innkeeper statute, govern the placement of the law (many statutes require that the statute be placed in a common area, at the front desk, or behind the door of the room) and the size of the text of the displayed statute.  Generally, to be protected under the statutes, the innkeeper and his employees cannot be complicit in the theft or the loss of property.  Lastly, the innkeeper usually has to provide a safe for the safekeeping of the guests’ property.  

American statutes also govern [[bailments]].  A bailment is the “delivery of an item of property, for some purpose, with the expressed or implied understanding that the person receiving it shall return it in the same or similar condition in which it was received, when the purpose has been completed.” &lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009).   Hospitality Law.  p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Coat checks, safety deposit boxes, and luggage storage are common examples of bailments for the hospitality industry.  It is important for lodging and restaurant&lt;ref&gt; While the bailment section is discussed under lodging, the concept is also application to restaurant operators, since many have coat checks.&lt;/ref&gt;operators to understand that they are responsible for the safety of the guest’s property when a bailment is established.  

===Restaurants===

Restaurant operators in the United States have a duty to sell food that is merchantable, that is, suitable for buying and selling.&lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009).  Hospitality Law.  p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Truth in Menu” laws govern descriptions of food in menus.  These laws ensure that the customer receives what the menu says he or she will (e.g., one dozen oysters for a certain amount, instead of 11 oysters).  They also govern the ingredients, nutritional descriptions, preparation style, and more.  For example, a bill once introduced to the New York City Council required that the use of the words “homestyle” or “homemade” refer to dishes prepared “from scratch.”&lt;ref&gt; Jeffries and Banks.  Understanding Hospitality Law.  Fourth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government has had a long history of regulating food advertisement and sales.  In 2003, the [[FDA]] began to require labels to include trans fat content.  

The [[National Restaurant Association]] produces a helpful guide for restaurateurs - A Practical Guide to the Nutrition Labeling Law -to help the restaurant industry understand what nutrition claims it can make on its menu items.  

==Relation to Other Laws==

===Anti-Trust===

Antitrust laws regulate business conduct to preserve competition and to prevent economic coercion.  Hotel operators should not enter into an understanding regarding 1) room rates and conditions and terms of providing rooms or 2)  scope of operations.&lt;ref&gt; Jeffries and Banks.  Understanding Hospitality Law.  Fourth Edition.  p. 472.  Please see this resource for more specific examples of prohibited activity for operators. &lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to remember that a hotel operator is ordinarily responsible if its managers or employees violate antitrust laws.

===Contracts===

There are two main types of contracts applicable to the hospitality industry:  franchise contracts and management contracts.

A franchise agreement dictates the terms, rights, and responsibilities between the franchisee and the franchisor.    It covers termination policies, each party’s responsibilities, indemnification, and more.  Franchise agreements should be carefully reviewed by an attorney.

A [[management contract]] covers the duties and responsibilities between a management company and the business owner.  Management contracts covers fees, the management company’s investment or ownership, exclusivity, and more.&lt;ref&gt; Administration of Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management Contracts by James Eyster (1980) is a valuable resource for management contracts.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort Laws===

Torts, including negligence (as described above), intentional acts, [[assault]], and more, are also relevant for the hospitality industry.  Lodging operators need to be aware of their duties to guests in parking lots.  Restaurant operators that serve [[alcohol]] should also be aware of their duties to their guests when patrons become belligerent or hostile to each other or to other guests.  

==International Hospitality Law==

In many parts of the world, the hospitality industry is referred to as the “travel and tourism” industry or the “tourism” industry.  

Several global organizations are in place to improve and promote the global travel industry, including the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO).

&quot;'''Family Meeting'''&quot; is the 13th and final episode of the seveneth and final season of [[The Shield]]. The episode aired on FX on November 25th, 2008, and was written by [[Shawn Ryan]] and directed by [[Clark Johnson]]. The title comes from a line [[Shane Vendrell]] ([[Walton Goggins]]) calls to his family during the episode.

==Plot Summary==

The episode starts with Vic meeting Ronnie and telling him that the Shane didn't show up to the drop off and that Corinne was arrested. He also tells him that Olivia agreed to clear himself, Ronnie and Corinne once they arrest Beltran. They meet with Beltran and he agrees to meet with the black board of directors at the exchange.

Meanwhile, Dutch tells Corinne about the deal Vic made for full immunity which causes her to panic. He assures her that they have an idea to keep her safe from Vic if he finds out what she did to him.

Shane takes Mara and their son back to their house and they plan to leave the next day when the police are busy guarding the president.

Back at the barn, Claudette convinces Olivia to put Vic's family in federal protection to keep him away from them.

Vic goes to his house to tell Corinne that she is safe.

Shane shows up to surprise Billings and asks him to deliver a message. The message is that Mara shot the woman in self defense. He also tells him that he is willing to turn himself in and testify against Vic and Ronnie if they can guarantee immunity for Mara. He gives him an attorney's card and tells him to contact him.

At the exchange, Beltran doesn't show up and sends his men instead. This angers the black board of directors. The deal is about to go sour, so ICE moves in and arrests everyone. Olivia tells Vic that he is no longer involved and should back off the Beltran case. He decides to go after him, nonetheless, to honor his deal and Ronnie backs him up.

Lloyd show's up at the barn to report his mother: Rita, missing and Dutch believes he killed her. Lloyd says the last time he saw her was the night before and that she was upset about a fight she had with Dutch. He claims she left at 3 a.m. to go see Dutch at his house. Dutch tells Claudette about the mysterious hang up calls he got from Rita that made him go to her house the morning before. They believe Lloyd killed his mother and made those calls to implicate Dutch.

Julien and Tina respond to a noise complaint which is a rally for Robert Huggins, a local man running for mayor who they end up arresting. 

Shane calls the attorney and finds out that Claudette is only willing to offer reduced charges for Mara. He then calls Vic for help. Vic refuses and tells him about the deal he cut with ICE. Shane responds by telling him that Corinne was working with the police against him because she didn't want him near their children. Vic tells him that he'll check up on his children when he and Mara are in prison to tell them stories about what their parents did.

Olivia informs Vic that Corinne requested protection from him and that he would no longer be able to see his children.

Back at the barn, Claudette pulls Dutch off of the case after unis found burnt women's clothing in a trash container at his house. 

Robert Huggins makes bail and requests police protection since threats were made against him, but the request is ignored.

Billing's attorney meets with Dutch and asks him to change his statement because it's not helpful to his case against the department.

Shane buys flowers and a toy for Mara and Jackson.

Vic and Ronnie get Santiago to give up the location of Beltran. Vic suspected he would know where it is since he probably delivered the drugs instead of Beltran. He then calls Olivia to tell her the location but she refuses to help him.

Huggins interrupts a rally for Aceveda and questions him as a mayoral candidate.

Back at the barn, Billings is unable to get Lloyd to say anything and all the evidence points to Dutch. Dutch feels guilty for what he believes happened to Rita and asks for another shot at Lloyd. Claudette refuses and decides to interrogate him herself. She tells him she's convinced that Dutch may have had something to do with his mother's disappearance.

Back at the rally, Huggins continues to insult Aceveda until he is escorted out of the building.

Billing's attorney convinces Dutch to change his statement to keep Billings safe from the department's counter suit.

Shane goes back home and runs into a neighbor. He gives the presents he bought to his family. The neighbor calls the police and they go to his house. As soon as they enter, Shane kills himself with a revolver. They also find Mara and Jackson dead lying on the bed. There is a note next to Shane's body.

Shane calls Aceveda and asks him for help in arresting Beltran. He agrees after realizing it would be a good PR move for him that could get him more voters.

Vic and Ronnie head to Beltran's hideout and wait for ICE thinking that Aceveda would convince them to show up. However, they feel that Beltran is about to leave so they have to move in alone. They secure Beltran and his men and the ICE agents arrive. The drugs are found and Beltran is arrested.

Back at the barn, Billings thanks Dutch for changing his statement and informs him that he got a good settlement. Dutch later learns from his attorney that all he got was back pay for 2 days of missed work. She also gives him her card and tells him to call her some time!

At the warehouse, Aceveda arrives to talk with the press about the drug bust. Olivia tells Ronnie to get back to the barn where Vic knows he will be arrested.

Claudette tells Lloyd that she knows he's a murderer and that he's now a suspect in his mother's disappearance. She also reveals to Dutch that she's dying.

Tina and Julien respond to a call and find that Huggins has been shot. He dies in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

Vic shows up at the barn and gets dirty looks from everyone there. He finds Ronnie crying, who informs him about Shane killing himself and his family. Claudette asks to speak with Vic in the interrogation room and makes him sit on the suspect's side of the table. She tells Vic about the note Shane wrote and reads it to him: &quot;I guess enough painkillers can make even the worst kind of hurt go away. The thing you need to know is that Mara was innocent and Jackson was innocent; they didn't know what they were drinking and their last moments together were happy ones. They left the way I first found them, perfect and innocent. They were innocent and they are in heaven now and we'll always be a family. The guilty ones are me and Vic. Vic lead but I kept following. I don't think one's worse than the other, but we made each other into something worse than our individual selves. I wish I'd never met him. I see it all now. There is no apologies I can make, no explanations I can give. I was who I was and I can't be that person any more. I can't let myself...&quot;. The note is incomplete because he shot himself before he could finish it. Claudette tells Vic that she hope's he's proud of himself and shows him pictures of Shane and his family. Vic's face twitches and there is a long silence. He realizes that Claudette is watching him from the monitoring room so he rips out the surveillance camera and tells her to bill him for it on his way out. Claudette signals to Dutch and he proceeds to arrest Ronnie. Ronnie flips out when he learns of Vic's betrayal.

The next morning, Vic goes to ICE to start his new job. He asks Olivia about where his family is but she refuses to tell him. She then breaks the news that he won't be working on the streets for ICE. His job is to give daily reports about gang related activity. Vic refuses this desk job, but Olivia tells him that if he doesn't take the job for the next 3 years he will be prosecuted for all his confessed crimes.

At the barn, Aceveda tells Claudette that there is no truth to rumors that he was involved with Huggins' death. He asks her how she's holding up and tells her that they both spent a lot of time trying to put Vic away. She congratulates him on becoming mayor.

Vic returns to ICE in a suit and tie and is given a tour of his new work environment. He is visibly angry and upset.

A federal agent shows Corinne and her children their new home and describes the neighborhood. He tells them that the home is pretty basic, but Corinne thinks it's fine.

Back at the barn, the Unis have a small celebration for Tina's one year anniversary, which is soon interrupted by a robbery call.

Back at ICE, Vic, still visibly angry, places pictures of his children on his desk and a picture of himself and Lem. He smiles when he looks at the picture of Lem. He hears sirens and looks outside the window and sees some patrol cars. He returns to his desk and sits quietly for a while looking more and more emotional. He seems to be about to cry upon seeing the pictures of his children and thinking about everything that has happened to him. Finally, the lights go out, he takes his gun out of a lock box, puts on his jacket and leaves.

The episode ends with a montage of all the characters and events in the show.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/The+Shield/Family+Meeting/episode/1226034/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_recap&lt;/ref&gt;</text>

'''Ōtara''' is a suburb of [[Manukau City]], one of the cities which make up the [[Greater Auckland]] [[metropolitan area]] in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  Situated 18 kilometres to the southeast of Auckland city centre, Ōtara lies near the head of the [[Tamaki River|Tāmaki River]] (actually an arm of the [[Hauraki Gulf]]), which extends south towards the [[Manukau Harbour]].  Contemporary Ōtara is surrounded by the suburbs of [[Otahuhu|Ōtāhuhu]], [[Middlemore]], [[Papatoetoe]], [[Flat Bush]], and [[East Tamaki|East Tāmaki]].  The suburb is noted for its proportion of [[Pacific Islander]] residents, who make up 68% of the Ōtara population, and its unusually low number of [[New Zealand European]] ([[Pākehā]]) residents (13%).&lt;ref name=&quot;CENSUS2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.manukau.govt.nz/uploadedFiles/manukaugovtnz/Around_Manukau/Statistics/Otara%20Community%202006.pdf Otara Ward] (Census Profile 2006, [[Manukau City Council]]. Accessed 2009-08-10.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Māori Heritage==
In the [[Māori language]], ''Ō-Tara'' means ‘the place of Tara’ or ‘territory belonging to Tara’, who was a [[Rangatira]] (or [[Māori]] Chief) of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Tonson, A.E - ''Old Manukau'' - Auckland, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;  'Ōtara' is in turn the shortened form of '''Te Puke Ō Tara''' (literally; ‘The Hill of Tara’); known also for a time as Smales Mount.&lt;ref&gt;La Roche, Alan J. - ''A History of Puke O Tara (Smales Mt) and Hampton Park'' - Manukau, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Te Puke Ō Tara was one of Ōtara's prominent [[volcanic cone|volcanic cones]], and prior to European settlement in the area was the site of a [[scoria]] cone [[Pā]].  Like most of Auckland, the Ōtara landscape is volcanic in origin and forms a part of what is known as the East Tāmaki volcanic field, with Te Puke Ō Tara and Mātanginui (Greenmount) having been the dominant cones of Ōtara.  Mātanginui was also a Pā site, and the areas surrounding both Pā are thought to represent the densest area of pre-European settlement in East Tāmaki, favoured for rich volcanic gardening soils and fresh water springs.&lt;ref&gt;‘Alatini, Moses Ngaluapea - ''Housing and Related Social Conditions of the Tongan Community living in Otara'' - Auckland, 2004, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulmer, Susan - ''Sources for the Archaeology of the Maaori Settlement of the Taamaki Volcanic District'' - Wellington, 1994, p.39-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smytheman, I.F &amp; Tonson, A.E - ''Our First Hundred Years, An Historical Record of Papatoetoe'' Papatoetoe (1962), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tāngata whenua]] of Ōtara are the local [[iwi]] known as [[Ngāi Tai]] (also called Ngāti Tai).  Ngāti Tai are said to have originated as a distinct iwi identity on the eastern coastline of Auckland shortly after the [[Tainui (canoe)|Tainui]] [[waka]] called there in about the mid-14th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Geo. - ''Tainui'' in ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'' (Vol.60), 1951, pp.82-84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Pei Te Hurinui - ''Nga Iwi o Tainui'' - Auckland, 1995 (Ed. Bruce Biggs), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, G. J. - ''A History of the Human Occupation of the Whakakaiwhara Block'' - Auckland, 1996, pp.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taua, Te Warena in La Roche, Alan (Ed.) - ''The History of Howick &amp; Pakuranga'' - Howick, 1991, pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ngāi Tai tradition, Te Puke Ō Tara and Ōtara are named after the [[Ariki]] (Paramount Chief) of Ngāi Tai known as '''Tara Te Irirangi''', who lived from the late 18th Century until 1852.

Over time, with the emergence and expansion of later [[hapū]] and iwi identities, Ngāti Tai occupying the Ōtara area became closely interlinked by marriages with Te Akitai, Ngāti Tamaoho and Ngāti Kahu of the [[Tāmaki Makaurau]] confederation of tribes known collectively as Te Wai ō Hua, and with the [[Hauraki Gulf|Hauraki]] peoples of [[Ngāti Paoa|Ngāti Pāoa]] and [[Ngāti Tamaterā]], among others.  The Ngāti Pāoa chieftain Hauauru noted in 1851 that by the mid-1830s Ngāti Pāoa, Ngāti Tamaterā and Te Akitai had competing interests in Ōtara.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D., Rigby, B., and Russell, M. - ''Old Land Claims'' - Wellington ([[Waitangi Tribunal]]), 1997, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; While all of these groups hold ancestral relationships to the Ōtara area, Ngāi Tai continue to retain recognised [[mana|mana whenua]] status.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jennifer A. - ''East Tamaki: Including the Adjoining Areas of Flat Bush and Otara'' - Papatoetoe, 2002, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Settlement==
During the 1830s, Ōtara was among many present-day suburbs of Manukau &amp; Auckland originally included within the boundaries of what became known as the &quot;Tāmaki Block&quot; or &quot;Fairburn Purchase&quot;.  Between 1836 and 1839, the newly arrived Church Mission Society (CMS) missionary William Thomas Fairburn began moves to establish a mission station at [[Maraetai]] while attempting to purchase a vast tract of land from various iwi of Auckland.  Brokered as &quot;an act of Christian peacemaking&quot; between warring tribes on the Tāmaki isthmus, Fairburn obtained &quot;signatures&quot; to the deed of purchase from over 30 Rangatira; few, if any of whom could read or write.  Fairburn originally estimated the total area to contain 40,000 acres, but it was later surveyed as being around 83,000.  When the purchase came under scrutiny from the CMS, in 1837 Fairburn signed a deed promising to return one third of the land to the original inhabitants (a transaction which never took place), and unsuccessfully attempted to offer another third to the Church.  Following the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] establishing New Zealand as a [[British Colony]] in 1840, Fairburn came under investigation from the new Government's Land Claims Commission.  Following a protracted investigation (during which time Fairburn resigned from the mission), in 1848 the Commission disallowed Fairburn's original claim, awarding him instead a much smaller grant of just under 5,500 acres.  The remainder of the land, including Ōtara, was retained by the Crown as &quot;surplus land&quot; to be onsold to European settlers.  Following the protests of Hori Te Whetuki on behalf of Ngāi Tai, in 1854 the Commission granted a &quot;Native Reservation&quot; of just over 6,000 acres at Umupuia to &quot;the chiefs of the Ngatitai&quot; and paid them £500 compensation, on the condition that they sign an agreement to vacate all other lands within the original purchase boundaries, and order all other iwi to do the same.  

European settlement of Ōtara began in earnest from the 1850s onwards, with most settlers of the wider East Tāmaki area being comprised of Scottish and Irish [[Presbytarianism|Presbytarians]].  The most prominent settler of Ōtara during this period was the Wesleyan missionary Reverend Gideon Smales, who had arrived from England in 1840, and upon his retirement moved to settle at East Tāmaki, purchasing a 400 acre block from the Government in 1855, which included Te Puke Ō Tara.  Smales farmed the land at the foot of Te Puke Ō Tara and opened a quarry on the mountain; the entirety of which has since been destroyed.  Mātanginui Pā was also largely destroyed by quarrying from 1870 onwards and is now the site of the Greenmount Landfill.&lt;ref&gt;La Roche (2000), pp.1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulmer (1994), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Alatini (2004), p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  13 acres from the Smales Mount/Puke Ō Tara estate on the remains of the original cone now form reserve known as Te Puke Ō Tara Hampton Park, which includes a stone church built in the 1860s and the remains of extensive stone walls from Smales' farm, both constructed from the quarried scoria.

Farming and rural industries remained the dominant characteristic of Ōtara throughout the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.

==Urbanisation==
{{Expand section}}
Following World War II, Ōtara was developed by the Auckland Regional Authority as a State Housing area.

==Contemporary Culture==
{{Expand section}}
Ōtara is &quot;The Heart of Manukau City&quot; and the home of the &quot;Ōtara Global Village&quot; developing in the old relocated Baird's Intermediate school which was moved to the new site of the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate and renamed SEHC Middle School.

The suburb achieved a mild degree of worldwide fame with the one-off hit single ''[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]'', by hip-hop artists [[OMC (band)|OMC]]. &quot;OMC&quot; stands for &quot;Otara Millionaires' Club&quot; - a tongue-in-cheek reference to the low socio-economic status of much of the suburb, Ōtara being one of the poorest parts of the Auckland region - Ōtara North being Auckland Region's suburb with the second lowest median income, at NZ$25,900 after [[Great Barrier Island]] at NZ$25,100, and compared to an average of NZ$37,300 and the highest value of NZ$60,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10580186 We're getting richer but gap is widening] - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Tuesday 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōtara is also known for its Saturday morning '[[Flea market]]' held in the Ōtara shopping center car park next to [[Manukau Institute of Technology|Manukau Institute of Technology's]] South Campus.

In the 1970s [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Muldoon]]'s immigration policies led to [[dawn raid]]s on some Ōtara residents by police in the search for illegal overstayers from the Pacific Islands.

Born in 1919, he was 25 at the time of the murders, and 90 at the time of his conviction by a German court (he had been convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 2006).

He served in the German army during World War Two and it was during that conflict that he ordered the capture and summary execution of ten civilians as a resprisal for the killing of two german soldiers under his command.

It was speculated at the time of his conviction that his may be last conviction for Nazi-era crimes.</text>

'''How It all Started.
Demarius Wallace Who Is known to some people as 4DAmbition.
Started rapping at the age of 5 in a small town known as Madisonville Texas.
He quit For 7 years, and then started getting back into the game of rap at the middle age of 13.
He knew a person that new somebody that could get him a career at the time.
But Sadly at the time 4DAmbition was just nearing the end of school and was trying to learn more about the rap game.
(Currently at the time 4DAmbition didn't know anything about rap names meaning who you are, or why you call yourself that.)
(He was also Focusing on sounding like Tupac Shakur, Who was known as 2Pac
For being the greatest Rapper of all time)
A Month Later he decided that he wanted to be more ''Original'' So he came up with the name Rebarius.
Which stood for the name of monster or a stone cold beast.
But He could not figure out a ''GOOD'' reason to call himself that so he came up with the name Reashaun.
2 Weeks later his cousin said that the name sounded like the name of a singer.
So he thought hard about it and came up with his New name ''4DAmbition''.
He's Currently wiriting songs known as '''''Major Swag Upgrade''''' '''''Swagger Inn''''' '''''Lots of recognition''''' and '''''Everybody Aint perfect'''''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A fleet of four-wheeled &quot;toastrack&quot; coaches were made for the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] on the [[Isle of Man]] between 1896 and 1905.  They were all supplied by G.F. Milnes &amp; Co. of [[Birkenhead]] and were of similar design and resemblde a smaller version of the trailers used on the [[Manx Electric Railway]] nearby, and were originally either varnised or painted a dark colour (contemporary postcards make it difficult to tell which) but the restored versions are varnished and carry no lining out, which is evident from early views.
[[Image:Ggr-coach.jpg|thumb|right|The line's resident re-built toastrack set with replica battery engine &quot;Polar Bear&quot;.]]

==&quot;A&quot; Coaches==
The original four-wheeled &quot;toastrack&quot; coaches supplied with &quot;Sea Lion&quot; in 1896 were never originally numbered but are known as the &quot;A&quot; coaches; there feature stone guards at rail level and a more plain valence design when compared to other coaches, though this was modified within the first year of operation as it is understood that the design was sufficiently prominent to allow passengers to bang their heads when boarding and alighting trains.  Today, there is one re-built 1896-type coach on the railway, carrying the number &quot;1&quot; but this bears no relation to original numbering, which varied from each repaint.  Two further original coaches reside at [[Amberley Chalk Pits Museum]] but these have flat roofs, whereas the resident one has a correctly curved roof.

==&quot;B&quot; Coach==
This was ordered owing to popularity of the line in the early years. This coach was slightly different from the others, having higher windows, different style valences, and is always known by its letter owing to these small differences; it remains to be re-built but several parts are in store, distinguishable from their odd dimensions when compared with the more standard fittings of the other coaches.  During the railway's centenary year in 1996 one of the [[1905]] built coaches that had been removed from the glen in 1967 and rebuilt at the [[West Lancashire Light Railway]] was returned to the line on loan, having since returned; it is to be noted that during its stay it carried a brass &quot;B&quot; in the bulkhead interior but this indicated &quot;borrowed&quot; rather than being the actual &quot;B&quot; coach, causing some confusion, the original having yet to be rebuilt.

==&quot;C&quot; &amp; &quot;D&quot; Coaches==
These were un-numbered originally and made up the final four coaches and arrived with Polar Bear in 1905 referred to as &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; type, the only major difference being the small style changed of valancing.  There are three restored coaches of this type with &quot;Polar Bear&quot; at Amberley Chalk Pits but the metalwork used is a mixture of all designs, and the result is something of a hybrid.  A further coach which serves as a disabled car.  A further original re-built coach is at the [[West Lancashire Light Railway]] but made a return to Groudle in 1996. There are currently two re-built 1905-type coaches resident on the [[Groudle Glen]] Railway which see regular service.

==Liveries==
It is understood from contemporary literature and limited photographic resources that the coaches delivered in 1896 were either varnished or painted in a dark colour.  Images purporting to be from opening day show the coaches with a light coloured lining-out on the valences and end panels, but no numbering is visible.  It is likely that if they were varnished this gave way to painting for appearance purposes.  The resident restored coaches are all varnished.  The set at [[Amberley Chalk Pits Museum]] are painted with black bulkhead panels, light brown valences, detailing and uprights, with further detailing in off-white, and grey floors.  It is not known whether this is an historically accurate livery or not.  By the final years of the line, the remaining servicable coaches appeared in a &quot;fairground&quot; livery of red and off-white (almost yellow), and evidence suggests that in the interim time they had recieved an all-over red/maroon colour scheme with white lining.

==Miscellaneous==
Owing to the number of newly fabricated parts on each site, both [[Groudle Glen]] and [[Amberley]], and a number of parts still in store, when the long-term project of completing the final coaches is done, it will result in there being more &quot;original&quot; coaches than there ever were on the railway.  A further 1896 coach is mid-way through being built, but the demise of the railway's in-house carpenter [[Harold Flavell]] in 2008 effectively ceased the project temporarily.  Each of the three resident coaches on the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] now carry brass plaques in memory of Mr. Flavell, who built all of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inheriting a title taken from the Infantas of Spain, Pedro Alcantara de Toledo y Salm Salm, XIII Duque del Infantado, was an extremely rich, powerful and popular figure in Spain generally and in court circles. He was ‘more educated than most of the Spanish grandees’&lt;ref&gt;A. Rabbe, Biographie Universelle (Paris, 1830)&lt;/ref&gt;, having been raised and schooled in Paris.
When Spain declared war on Revolutionary France in 1793, he raised an infantry regiment at his own expense.  He fought with it in Catalonia against the French beside a Portuguese division and commanded a brigade of the 2nd division of the army of Estremadura. After the treaty of Amiens, he used the peace to establish cotton mills in Catalonia using technical experts from England. In the following years he became very close to Ferdinand, the heir to the Spanish throne. This led him into conflict with the weak King Charles IV and his ambitious chief minister Godoy, and he was banished from Madrid in 1805. Within two years, and unfortunately for the Duke’s quiet life, Ferdinand was arrested and amongst his papers was found a nomination for the Duke to be Commander in Chief of the Spanish forces. Tried and sentenced to death as a traitor, he was reprieved by popular sentiment and the intervention of the French Ambassador.
A revolt in March 1808 resulted in the abdication of the king, the sacking of his manipulative chief minister Godoy and the ascent of Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throne, with the Duke of Infantado at his side. Taking advantage of the chaos, Napoleon ‘invited’ the factions including the Duke, to a conference in Bayonne. At this meeting a new Spanish constitution was signed by the assembled Spanish deputies that resulted in the throne passing to Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon’s brother. The only major Spanish figure that spoke in opposition was the Duke of Infantado, who ‘had opposed to the utmost any recognition of the foreign monarch’&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Recollections on the Private Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (The merriam Company, 1895)&lt;/ref&gt;. Not long afterwards the Duke called the nation to arms to resist the French, for which he was condemned as a traitor yet again, but this time by Napoleon. At the head of the Spanish army he was defeated by the French in 1809 at the battle of Ucles. His palace at Guadalajara and all his goods were confiscated by Joseph. The Duke joined forces with the British, at that time under Sir John Moore. He was extremely highly regarded by the British plenipotentiary, Mr J Hookham Frere, who was accustomed to late and inaccurate intelligence from his allies: ‘Had Sir John Moore been so fortunate as to find so candid a correspondent as the Duke of Infantado, a person who would describe things as they were, there is no doubt that the events and conclusion of the campaign would have been very different’&lt;ref&gt;J. Moore, A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain (J. Johnson, London, 1809)&lt;/ref&gt;, referring to Moore’s retreat to Corunna. Wellington later had much cordial correspondence with the Duke &lt;ref&gt;J. Gurwood, The Dispatches of The Duke of Wellington (London: John Murray, 1838)&lt;/ref&gt;during the later stages of the Peninsular War. Amusingly, but quite naturally for the times, all the correspondence between these allies during the war with France was in French.
In 1811 the Spanish parliament (the Cortes) nominated him as the President of the Council of Spain and sent him on a secret mission to the Prince Regent in London. He returned in 1812 and although he was proposed by Wellington as head of the 4th Army under British control, his enemies at the Spanish court decreed otherwise and he had to be content with leading his own regiment. After the end of the war with France in 1814 he retired again. He was recalled in 1823 to the Presidency of the Regency and was responsible for returning the king to the throne. Soon afterwards, tired of intrigue in the court and government, he retired to his country estates and eventually died there in 1841.
A postscript to the life of this leading Spaniard is less edifying. Pedro de Alcántara, the richest man in Spain, was succeeded firstly by his nephew who died childless after three years and then in turn by another nephew Mariano Téllez-Girón and Beaufort-Spontin (1814-1882), the 15th Duke of Infantado and the 12th Duke of Osuna. He was Spanish Ambassador in London, Paris and Moscow where the Russian Court were taken aback by his spending habits, reputably including bringing all his fresh flowers from Valencia to Moscow by train, throwing away clothes after one wearing and throwing solid gold dinner services into the Neva river after a banquet. His profligacy was such that one of his titles, Osuna, has been used as a Spanish byword for waste. All of his inheritance, the greatest fortune in Spain, was frittered in 38 years and at his death his personal possessions were auctioned to go towards paying his debts.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hotel Barges (Peniche Hôtel) ==
Following the decline in commercial and freight carriage on the canals of Europe many barges have been converted into floating hotels of varying degrees of luxury. This trend began in the 1960s and has now grown into a network of hotel barges operating on many of the canals and rivers of France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and the UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== History ==
When refering to travelling on the [[Canal du Midi]] in southern france [[Thomas Jefferson]], then ambassador to France before he became the third President of the United States, wrote to a friend almost 200 years before canal vacations became popular saying &quot;You should not think of returning to America without taking this tour I have taken&quot;. However, the practice of converting large barges (i.e. barges generally designed to fit into the locks of canals with minimal remaining volume) only began in 1966 with the Barge Palinurus, converted from carrying coal and captained by Richard Parsons on the canals of the Burgundy region of France. At the time the barge was equipped to take 20 passengers, with only one bath, two showers and two toilets shared between them, cruising on the River Yonne and the [[Burgundy Canal]] (Canal de Bourgogne).

The popularity of cruises, particularly amongst American clients, on this new type of boat was improved significantly thanks to the american writer Emily Kimborough and her book 'Floating Island' published in 1968, all about her experiences aboard the Palinurus. The high standards of accomodation expected by American clients rapidly drove the levels of luxury aboard hotel barges upwards. In 1969 Richard Parsons teamed up with Guy Bardet to launch Continental Waterways, a company that eventually ran 15 hotel barges in France.

3 decades later and the market for luxury vacations on floating hotels has grown even further, with over 200 cabins available on french canals alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== The 'Barging' Experience ==
Luxury Hotel barges have been cruising in Europe for over 30 years and are felt by many of their clients to be one of the most enjoyable, relaxing and luxurious ways of experiencing the country. Clients of the barges find that the waterways remain blissfully unspoilt and 'traffic-free'.  Usually cruising for a few hours each day, clientsl have time to take in all the sights and sounds, experiencing the wealth of history en route and catching a glimpse of times gone by.
Most hotel barges provide excursions in private vehicles that allow clients to enjoy local sights and experience the local culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Types of Hotel Barge Cruise ==
Hotel Barges come in a wide variety of sizes- some taking just four guests with others over 20 guests, with the size of accomodation varied to suit the physical dimensions of the hull. Levels of luxury range from 'comfortable Bed and Breakfast' right up to '5 star luxury, full board' with pricing to suit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Booking a Hotel Barge Holiday ==
The large number of barges, costs and variables in choice of accomodation mean that several brokers exist to help potential clients find which barge is right for their own vacation. These brokers are often based in the USA, with a few operating much closer to the barges in the UK and in France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Network Intelligence (NI)''' or '''Network Intelligence Technology (NIT)''' builds on the concepts and capabilities of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI) and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) to provide a more immediate and detailed understanding of data that transits communications networks. 

NI examines [[Packet_(information_technology)|IP data packets]] in real time by identifying the [communications protocols] used and extracting packet content and [[metadata]] for rapid analysis of data relationships and communications patterns. Its purpose is to harden network [[Computer_security|cyber security]] in enterprise and government environments, streamline current processes, and help businesses develop and manage new products and services that exploit [[Web_2.0|Web 2.0]] and wireless [[3G]] and [[4G]] technologies. 

NI extends the advancement of Internet business capabilities, security functions, and Internet [[data mining]]. Advocates of [[net neutrality]] who feared that DPI technology would be used to reduce the openness of the Internet will express the same reservations about NI, while NI advocates will argue that the technology will better protect lawful Internet users, enterprises and governments, and promote economic growth in telecommunications and other industries. NI is currently being incorporated into a wide range of applications by service providers, governments and large enterprises.

== Background ==
The evolution and growth of [[Internet]] and [[wireless]] technologies offer possibilities for new types of products and services,

Traditional DPI tools from established vendors like [[Sandvine]] and [[Allot]] have historically addressed network-focused applications such as [[bandwidth management]], [[Network_performance|performance optimization]] and [[Quality of Service]] (QoS). The expansion of real-time data capture and analysis capabilities with NI broadens the timeliness and depth of network visibility from these infrastructure-specific applications to commercial solutions such as mobile analytics, billing and policy management that rely on IP-based networks as platforms.


== Business Intelligence for data networks ==
In much the same way that BI technology synthesizes business application data from a variety of sources for business visibility and better decision-making, NI technology correlates network traffic data from a variety of data communication vehicles for network visibility, enabling better cyber security and IP services. 
With ongoing changes in communications networks and how information can be exchanged, people are no longer linked exclusively to physical subscriber lines. The same person can communicate in multiple ways – [[File_Transfer_Protocol|FTP]], [[Webmail]], [[Voice_over_Internet_Protocol|VoIP]], [[instant messaging]], [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[Social_network_service|social networks]] – and from different access points via desktops, laptops and mobile devices. 

NI provides the means to quickly identify, examine and correlate interactions involving Internet users, applications, and protocols whether or not the protocols are [[Tunnelling_protocol|tunneled]] or follow the [[OSI model]]. The technology enables a global understanding of network traffic for applications such as [[Lawful_interception|Lawful Intercept]] and [[Data_leakage_protection|Data Leakage Prevention]] that need to correlate information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, or who accesses what database, when, and the information viewed. When combined with traditional BI tools that examine service quality and customer care, this creates a powerful nexus of subscriber and network data.

== Use in Telecommunications ==
Telcos, [[Internet_Service_Provider|Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]] and [[Mobile_network_operator|Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)]] are under increasing competitive pressures to move to [[smart pipe]] business models. The cost savings and revenue opportunities driving smart pipe strategies also apply to [[Network_Equipment_Provider|Network Equipment Providers]], [[Independent_software_vendor|Software Vendors]] and [[Systems_integrator|Systems Integrators]] that serve the industry.  

Because NI captures detailed information from the hundreds of IP applications that cross mobile networks, it provides the required visibility and analysis of user demand to create and deliver differentiating services, as well as manage usage once deployed.

&lt;small&gt;NI as enabling technology for smart pipe applications&lt;/small&gt;

Customer metrics are especially important for telecom companies to understand consumer behaviors and create personalized IP services. NI enables faster and more sophisticated [[Audience_measurement|Audience Measurement]], User Behavior Analysis, [[Market_segment|Customer Segmentation]], and Personalized Services.

Real-time network metrics are equally important for companies to deliver and manage services. NI classifies protocols and applications from layers 2 through 7, generates metadata for communication sessions, and correlates activity between all layers, applicable for [[Optimization_(computer_science)|Bandwidth &amp; Resource Optimization]], [[Quality_of_service|Quality of Service (QoS)]], Content-Based Billing, [[Quality_of_experience|Quality of Experience (QoE)]], VoIP Fraud Monitoring and [[Regulatory_compliance|Regulatory Compliance]]. 


== Use in Cloud Computing ==
The economics and deployment speed of [[cloud computing]] is fueling rapid adoption by companies and government agencies.

|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NI mitigates the risks by providing [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]],[[Platform_as_a_service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] and [[Software_as_a_service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]] vendors with real-time [[situational awareness]] of network activity, and critical transparency to allay fears of potential customers. A vendor can demonstrate hardened network security to prevent [[Data_leakage_protection|Data Leakage]] or [[Data Theft]] and an irrefutable audit trail of all network transaction  – communication and content – related to a customer’s account.

== Use in Government == 
NI correlates information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, or who accesses what database, when and the information viewed, providing [[situational awareness]] for [[Lawful_interception|Lawful Interception]] and [[Cyber_security|Cyber Security]]. Real-time data capture, extraction and analysis allow security specialists to take preventive measures and protect network assets in real time as a complement post-mortem analysis after an attack. 

== Use in Business == 
Because NI combines real-time network monitoring with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for [[Database_security|Database Security]], [[Database_audit|Database Auditing]] and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for [[Network_performance_management|Network Performance Management]], Network Optimization, [[Customer_experience_management|Customer Experience Management]], [[Content_filtering|Content Filtering]], and internal billing of networked applications.

===Ratings===
The first season of ''Man v.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''PowerSwim''' is a device somewhat like two pairs of long thin airplane wings which are fastened to a [[scuba diver]]'s hips and legs: the longer pair (about {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide or a bit less) at the hips and the shorter pair at the ankles. It was developed by [[DARPA]] in 2007. It is claimed to let a [[scuba diver]] or [[frogman]] swim much faster (250%) than with [[swimfin]]s for the same amount of bodily effort, if used correctly, and being not motorized, it makes no motor noise to be heard by hostile [[hydrophone]]s. It works somewhat like a [[penguin]]'s or [[plesiosaur]]'s side-mounted flippers. Its estimated cost is less than $500. The diver uses it by moving his legs up and down together like with a [[monofin]]. It is claimed that the length of the front wing lets it operate outside the cone of [[wake]] that starts at the diver's shoulders.

Likely disadvantages:
*The width of the device would make it difficult to go through narrow gaps or near alongside something.
*It ties the diver's feet together.

==Aqueon==
'''Aqueon'' or '''Aqueaon''' was a similar device to PowerSwim. It was primarily developed in the 1970s by the [[Innerspace Corporation]], an aquatic propulsion company which specialized in [[submersible]] thrusters at the time. The first working Aqueon unit was sold in 1979. Its original designer was [[California Institute of Technology]] graduate Calvin &quot;Cal&quot; Gongwer.  It was claimed to provide three times as much thrust as conventional [[Swimfin|swimming fins]] and up to six times as much power, and that from a stationary start, a swimmer covered 25 yards in 8.4 seconds using Aqueon, and that with an Aqueon the swimmer covered 1500 yards with [[scuba equipment]] in 24 minutes; the fastest time covered by the same diver with scuba equipment and fins was 44 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rykaipiy''' ({{lang-ru|Рыркайпий}}) is a rural locality just to the west of [[Mys Shmidta]] in the [[Shmidtovsky District]] ([[Raion]]) of the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], part of the [[Far Eastern Federal District|Far Eastern]] [[federal districts of Russia|Federal District]] of [[Russia]].

The village is a small settlement, population as of 2003: 324 &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot;&gt; [http://redcross-chukotka.ru/English/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=17] Red Cross Chukotka &lt;/ref&gt;, most of whom are of [[Chukchi]] descent. The name of the village means &quot;''Place of the Walrus''&quot; in [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], &lt;ref name=&quot;capetocape.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.capetocape.org.uk/Marker%20pages/Schmidta.htm] capetocape.org.uk &lt;/ref&gt;, or &quot;''Walrus Jam''&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;, to convey the meaning that there are regularly large numbers of [[Walrus]] in the vicinity. Unsurprisingly, marine hunting has traditionally been a key source of food and employment for the local indigenous people &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;.

As with several of the rural settlements thorughout Chukotka, Rykaipiy was the centre for a [[collectivization in the USSR|collectivised]] farm centred around [[reindeer]]. Indeed it was the central farmstead for the largest of all the reindeer herding famrs thorughout Chukotka, named ''Pioneer''. Unlike other rural settlements in Chukotka such as [[Alkatvaam]] in [[Beringovsky District]] and [[Tavaivaam]] in [[Anadyrsky District]], following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] and payments to the farms from the government effectively ceased as Russia moved to a [[market economy]], the workers on this farm were able to keep their reindeer herds going and these herds are still the major source of employment for the local people, despite living on the coast &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;.

As with many Chukotkan villages, there are strong efforts made to keep the traditions of the indigenous peoples alive and although Rykaipiy has modern facilities in the shape of a hospital, post office, high school and daycare centre there is also a traditional [[Chukchi]] ensemble and cultural centre and Northern Star Native Womens Club &lt;ref name=&quot;chukotka&quot; /&gt;.

Computing systems rarely deliver best possible performance due to ever increasing hardware and software complexity and limitations of the current optimization technology. Additional code and architecture optimizations are often required to improve execution time, size, power consumption, reliability and other important characteristics of computing systems. Iterative compilation based on empirical feedback-directed optimization became a popular approach to optimize programs for different objective functions on architectures with ever growing complexity, when traditional compilers fails to deliver the best possible performance. However, lack of common research methodology and tools makes it difficult or even impossible to reproduce experiments and compare techniques from a large number of research publications on this topic.

The main aim of the community-driven [http://ctuning.org Collective Tuning Initiative] is to develop collaborative production-quality research tools with unified API (http://cTuning.org/cTools) and enable sharing profitable optimization cases from the community in the open optimization repository (http://cTuning.org/cdatabase). Using common R&amp;D tools should help to improve the quality and reproducibility of the research of code and architecture design and optimization, and boost innovation in this area. 

== Collaborative website ==

* http://ctuning.org

== cTuning optimization repository ==

* [[Collective_Optimization_Database|Collective Optimization Database]] is an open repository to share optimization cases from the community, provide web-services and plugins to analyze collective optimization data and predict good program optimizations based on statistical and machine learning techniques, and improve the quality and reproducibility of the compiler and architecture research.

== cTuning tools ==

* [http://ctuning.org/cpredict Online ML program optimization predictor (web-service)] is used to suggest profitable optimizations that improve execution time/code size/compilation time, etc based on similarities between programs (program features).

* [http://ctuning.org/ccc Continuous Collective Compilation Framework] is used to automate and distribute iterative feedback-directed exploration of large optimization spaces by multiple users.

* [[Interactive_Compilation_Interface|Interactive Compilation Interface]] &quot;opens up&quot; and transforms production compilers into stable interactive research toolsets using event-driven plugin system to avoid costly developments of new research compilers from scratch. 

* [http://ctuning.org/cbench Collective Benchmark] with multiple datasets is used to enable realistic benchmarking and research on iterative compilation and run-time adaptation.

* [http://ctuning.org/unidapt Universal Adaptation Framework] is used to enable run-time adaptation and optimization of statically-compiled programs for heterogeneous multi-core architectures.

Grime Daily was built from the heart of the UK grime and rap music scene, for the UK  music scene!  With the likes of World Star Hip Hop and Smack tube on the internet there was definitely a need for UK music from the underground to have a platform where people could actually see the artists.  Music visuals are very important as people want to be able to see the artists in the flesh to get a sense of the person, whether they are really like their music suggests, what kind of person they are? The UK music scene didn’t have any such platform!

Grime daily is trying to bring the UK music scene to a wider audience and wants to make sure UK grime music and underground UK music in general gets the recognition that it deserves. UK grime music and all of the other underground UK music’s such as  hip hop, UK funky, Drum and bass, Bassline, Dub step and anything else in the so called ‘UK urban scene’ gets out there and in peoples faces as there is some very good music out there to be heard.</text>

'''Ilija Grahovac''' called '''“Zmaj”''' (serbocroatian for Dragon) is a multiple awarded Cattle-breeder from a small Village near the town of Sipovo in the Republika Srbska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He became an internet celebrity after the appearance of a viral video showing him at his Fathers Funeral were he held a three-hour-long unrelated, strange and embarrassing speech and attacked people verbally who have shown anger about the length of the speech.
Soon these parts of the video found their way to the internet and made Ilija famous, this caught the attention of some TV-Stations which interviewed him, these interviews too were strange and also found their way to youtube and other portals.
This all led to a “sequel”,  Ilija recorded a new tape which was called “Dioba” in this film it is shown how Ilija and his Brother divide Cattle they have inherited from their father.
Also some of Ilijas Family and Neighbors are shown at his home, in this movie too there are shown Speeches which Ilija held while drinking Beer out of his winner-Cups, and it seems that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Weeks later there were seen unauthorized copys of the Funeral and Dioba in Bosnian Videoshops, wrapped in fan-made Covers.
There are rumors about a third Film with Ilija Grahovac which is said to be a porn-movie, but till today such a movie hasn’t emerged from the net and the rumors about its existence may be triggered trough another Video in which Ilija talks about his potency and strength in bed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article details the bogie coaches that operate on the [[Groudle Glen Railway]] on the [[Isle of Man]].  Forming the frontline service fleet for day-to-day operation these coaches were built in-house by the line's carpenters, on the frames of two coaches purchased from [[Doddington, Cheshire|Doddington Park]] in [[Chipping Sodbury]] when restoration began.  The original bodywork was deemed unsafe and not suitable for repair, although the coachwork was loosly based on this.

==No. 1==
The first coach to arrive in the glen in 1985 this coach was originally roofless.  It did not have brakegear initially, this being added in the third season of operation.  To overcome this, all trains ran with a four-wheeled &quot;bomb&quot; wagon at either end to provide braking.  By 1988 it had been fitted with an overall roof and valences to match the second coach, it remains in service today largely unaltered.

==No. 2==
Following the same pattern as No. 1 but having a roof fitted when built, this coach was delivered in time for the return of steam locomotive &quot;Sea Lion&quot; in 1987 and is largely identical to the first coach, save for having the braking equipment and associated guards' accomodation at the alternative end, meaning the coaches always run in the same formation with a guards' compartment at each extremity of the train.  Unaltered since arrival it remains in regular service today.

==No. 3==
The third coach which was completed and delivered in 1994 is only used at peak times and always rides between the other two coaches.  It is slightly different from the original two, owing to the proposed all-weather appearance which has not been executed.

==Livery==
All the coaches are painted in a maroon livery, the original two carrying G.G.R. lettering until repaint in 2001 when this was lost; however in 2007 all three coaches were fitted with the new railway crest; interiors are black painted bench seating with black (changed from grey in early 2008) floors, featuing a hand-brake at one end of the vehicle.

==Miscellaneous==
The coaches all feature a valance along their lengths using the same pattern as the original 1905 type coaches to give them a more authentic appearance. The coaches are numbered one to three but their fleet numbers are not immediately apparent as they are only painted on one end on the underframe.

Panmure House was designed by the king's master mason [[John Mylne (1611-1667)|John Mylne]], although he died in 1667, before it was completed. The client was George Maule, 3rd Earl of Panmure (1650–1686). On Mylne's death, the work was continued by Alexander Nisbet, an Edinburgh mason, and the interior was fitted out by James Bain, the king's wright. Sir [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] was sometimes credited with the design in the past, and he did apparently advise the earl after Mylne's death, but he only designed the gates and gate piers.&lt;ref name=Gow&gt;Gow, pp.52–58&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the 3rd Earl, his son [[James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure|James]], now 4th Earl, added the wings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Muljangori-oreum''' wetland is a mountain crater lake formed at the volcanic crater, which is at 900m~937m above the sea  level, 9km of the northeast side of Mt. Halla (1,950 m). The 628000m&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; lake provides water, which is not abundant on the island, to hawks, fairy pitas, black kites, Japanese lesser sparrow hawks, black paradise flycatchers and other rare animals

==Characteristics==
Muljangori-oreum is a parasitic cone formed by volcanic activities at the end of the third Cenozoic Era and exists only in Jeju island. Around Halla-san, about 370 parasitic cones are located and only about 30% of them has mountain craters. Oreum is mostly composed of water-permeable basalt, so it’s difficult to have a wet mountain crater lake on the top of Oreum.

The lake(Muljangori-oreum) 900m above the sea level maintains its surface water by the rainfall. During the dry season, most part of wetland becomes dry except the deepest hole in the south (about 50 m of water depth) and during the rainy season, most of it gets submerged under the water.

==Organisms==
'''Birds'''
* [[Peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus'')
* [[Fairy pitta]] (''Pitta brachyura nympha'')
* [[black kite]] (''Milvus migrans'')
* [[Japanese sparrowhawk]] (''Accipiter gularis'')
* [[Japanese paradise-flycatcher]] (''Terpsiphone atrocaudata'')
* [[obovata peony]] (''Paeonia obovata''). 
* [[Black paradise  flycatcher]] (''Terpsiphone atrocaudata'')
* [[Fabriciana nerippe]] (F:Papilionoidea) 
* [[Lethocerus deyrollei]] (F: Belostomatidae).


'''Plants'''
* Japanese strawberry tree (''Cornus kousa'' ), 
* Painted Maple (''Acer pictum subsp. monoi'' ), 
* Juncus effusus 
* Scripus triangulates, 
* Persicaria hydropiper.
